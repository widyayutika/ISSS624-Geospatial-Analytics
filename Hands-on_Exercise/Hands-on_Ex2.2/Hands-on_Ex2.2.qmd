## Getting Started

### **The analytical question**

In spatial policy, one of the main development objective of the local government and planners is to ensure equal distribution of development in the province. Our task in this study, hence, is to apply appropriate spatial statistical methods to discover if development are even distributed geographically. If the answer is **No**. Then, our next question will be "is there sign of spatial clustering?". And, if the answer for this question is yes, then our next question will be "where are these clusters?"

In this case study, we are interested to examine the spatial pattern of a selected development indicator (i.e. GDP per capita) of Hunan Provice, People Republic of China.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunan)

### **The Study Area and Data**

Two data sets will be used in this hands-on exercise, they are:

-   Hunan province administrative boundary layer at county level. This is a geospatial data set in ESRI shapefile format.

-   Hunan_2012.csv: This csv file contains selected Hunan's local development indicators in 2012.

### **Setting the Analytical Tools**

Before we get started, we need to ensure that **spdep**, **sf**, **tmap** and **tidyverse** packages of R are currently installed in your R.

-   sf is use for importing and handling geospatial data in R,

-   tidyverse is mainly use for wrangling attribute data in R,

-   spdep will be used to compute spatial weights, global and local spatial autocorrelation statistics, and

-   tmap will be used to prepare cartographic quality chropleth map.

The code chunk below is used to perform the following tasks:

-   creating a package list containing the necessary R packages,

-   checking if the R packages in the package list have been installed in R,

    -   if they have yet to be installed, RStudio will installed the missing packages,

-   launching the packages into R environment.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, spdep, tmap, tidyverse)
```

## **Getting the Data Into R Environment**

In this section, you will learn how to bring a geospatial data and its associated attribute table into R environment. The geospatial data is in ESRI shapefile format and the attribute table is in csv fomat.

### **Import shapefile into r environment**

The code chunk below uses [*st_read()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/st_read.html) of **sf** package to import Hunan shapefile into R. The imported shapefile will be **simple features** Object of **sf**.

```{r}
hunan <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", 
                 layer = "Hunan")
```

### **Import csv file into r environment**

Next, we will import *Hunan_2012.csv* into R by using *read_csv()* of **readr** package. The output is R data frame class.

```{r}
hunan2012 <- read_csv("data/aspatial/Hunan_2012.csv")
```

### **Performing relational join**

The code chunk below will be used to update the attribute table of *hunan*'s SpatialPolygonsDataFrame with the attribute fields of *hunan2012* dataframe. This is performed by using *left_join()* of **dplyr** package.

```{r}
hunan <- left_join(hunan,hunan2012) %>%
  select(1:4, 7, 15)
```

### **Visualising Regional Development Indicator**

Now, we are going to prepare a basemap and a choropleth map showing the distribution of GDPPC 2012 by using *qtm()* of **tmap** package.

```{r}
equal <- tm_shape(hunan) +
  tm_fill("GDPPC",
          n = 5,
          style = "equal") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Equal interval classification")

quantile <- tm_shape(hunan) +
  tm_fill("GDPPC",
          n = 5,
          style = "quantile") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Equal quantile classification")

tmap_arrange(equal, 
             quantile, 
             asp=1, 
             ncol=2)
```

## **Global Spatial Autocorrelation**

In this section, you will learn how to compute global spatial autocorrelation statistics and to perform spatial complete randomness test for global spatial autocorrelation.

### **Computing Contiguity Spatial Weights**

Before we can compute the global spatial autocorrelation statistics, we need to construct a spatial weights of the study area. The spatial weights is used to define the neighbourhood relationships between the geographical units (i.e. county) in the study area.

In the code chunk below, [*poly2nb()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/poly2nb.html) of **spdep** package is used to compute contiguity weight matrices for the study area. This function builds a neighbours list based on regions with contiguous boundaries. If you look at the documentation you will see that you can pass a "queen" argument that takes TRUE or FALSE as options. If you do not specify this argument the default is set to TRUE, that is, if you don't specify queen = FALSE this function will return a list of first order neighbours using the Queen criteria.

More specifically, the code chunk below is used to compute Queen contiguity weight matrix.

```{r}
wm_q <- poly2nb(hunan, 
                queen=TRUE)
summary(wm_q)
```

The summary report above shows that there are 88 area units in Hunan. The most connected area unit has 11 neighbours. There are two area units with only one neighbours.

### **Row-standardised weights matrix**

Next, we need to assign weights to each neighboring polygon. In our case, each neighboring polygon will be assigned equal weight (style="W"). This is accomplished by assigning the fraction 1/(#ofneighbors) to each neighboring county then summing the weighted income values. While this is the most intuitive way to summaries the neighbors' values it has one drawback in that polygons along the edges of the study area will base their lagged values on fewer polygons thus potentially over- or under-estimating the true nature of the spatial autocorrelation in the data. For this example, we'll stick with the style="W" option for simplicity's sake but note that other more robust options are available, notably style="B".

```{r}
rswm_q <- nb2listw(wm_q, 
                   style="W", 
                   zero.policy = TRUE)
rswm_q
```

The input of *nb2listw()* must be an object of class **nb**. The syntax of the function has two major arguments, namely style and zero.poly.

-   *style* can take values "W", "B", "C", "U", "minmax" and "S". B is the basic binary coding, W is row standardised (sums over all links to n), C is globally standardised (sums over all links to n), U is equal to C divided by the number of neighbours (sums over all links to unity), while S is the variance-stabilizing coding scheme proposed by Tiefelsdorf et al. 1999, p. 167-168 (sums over all links to n).

-   If *zero policy* is set to TRUE, weights vectors of zero length are inserted for regions without neighbour in the neighbours list. These will in turn generate lag values of zero, equivalent to the sum of products of the zero row t(rep(0, length=length(neighbours))) %\*% x, for arbitrary numerical vector x of length length(neighbours). The spatially lagged value of x for the zero-neighbour region will then be zero, which may (or may not) be a sensible choice.

### **Global Spatial Autocorrelation: Moran's I**

In this section, you will learn how to perform Moran's I statistics testing by using [*moran.test()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/moran.test.html) of **spdep**.

### **Maron's I test**

The code chunk below performs Moran's I statistical testing using [*moran.test()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/moran.test.html) of **spdep**.

```{r}
moran.test(hunan$GDPPC, 
           listw=rswm_q, 
           zero.policy = TRUE, 
           na.action=na.omit)
```

**Question:** What statistical conclusion can you draw from the output above?

**Ans:**

H0: The GDPPC values are randomly distributed across Hunan following a completely random process

The small p-value and the positive Moran's I statistic suggest that there is significant positive spatial autocorrelation in the **`hunan$GDPPC`** variable based on the provided spatial weights matrix. In other words, regions with similar GDPPC values tend to be spatially clustered in this dataset. The observed spatial pattern is unlikely to occur by random chance alone.

Note: It implements a **two-sided** test as opposed to the **one-sided** test adopted in the above example (i.e. `alternative = "greater"`). A two-sided p-value is nothing more than twice the one-sided p-value. However, there is no important distinction in any of the documentation provided. Fortunately, the GDPPC value is so strongly clustered that both a one-sided and two-sided test produce the same outcome (a p-value close to 0).

#### Computing Monte Carlo Moran's I

The code chunk below performs permutation test for Moran's I statistic by using [*moran.mc()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/moran.mc.html) of **spdep**. A total of 1000 simulation will be performed.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
bperm= moran.mc(hunan$GDPPC, 
                listw=rswm_q, 
                nsim=999, 
                zero.policy = TRUE, 
                na.action=na.omit)
bperm
```

**Question:** What statistical conclustion can you draw fro mthe output above?

**Ans:** The p-value of 0.001 is less than the conventional significance level of 0.05. Therefore, you would reject the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation. The results suggest that the observed spatial pattern in the **`hunan$GDPPC`** variable, as measured by Moran's I, is statistically significant and not likely due to random chance. The positive Moran's I value indicates positive spatial autocorrelation, meaning similar values are spatially clustered in the dataset.

#### Visualising Monte Carlo Moran's I

It is always a good practice for us the examine the simulated Moran's I test statistics in greater detail. This can be achieved by plotting the distribution of the statistical values as a histogram by using the code chunk below.

In the code chunk below [*hist()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/versions/3.6.2/topics/hist) and [*abline()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/versions/3.6.2/topics/abline) of R Graphics are used.

```{r}
mean(bperm$res[1:999])
```

```{r}
var(bperm$res[1:999])
```

```{r}
summary(bperm$res[1:999])
```

```{r}
hist(bperm$res, 
     freq=TRUE, 
     breaks=20, 
     xlab="Simulated Moran's I")
abline(v=0, 
       col="red") 
```

> **Question:** What statistical observation can you draw from the output above?
>
> **Ans:**
>
> -   The distribution of simulated Moran's I values under the null hypothesis provides a reference for what you would expect if spatial autocorrelation were due to random chance.
>
> -   The observed Moran's I value from the original data falls to the right of the distribution, indicating that the observed spatial autocorrelation is higher than what would be expected by random chance.
>
> -   The summary statistics and histogram support the conclusion drawn from the p-value in the previous analysis. The distribution of simulated Moran's I values suggests that the observed Moran's I from the original data is statistically significant and unlikely to be due to random chance. The positive skewness implies that positive spatial autocorrelation is less common under the null hypothesis than would be expected by chance.

> Challenge: Instead of using Base Graph to plot the values, plot the values by using ggplot2 package.

```{r}
# Create a data frame for the simulated Moran's I values
sim_data <- data.frame(Moran_I = bperm$res)

# Plot the histogram using ggplot2
ggplot(sim_data, aes(x = Moran_I)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.02, fill = "skyblue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Simulated Moran's I",
       x = "Simulated Moran's I",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "red", linetype = "dashed", size = 1)

```

### **Global Spatial Autocorrelation: Geary's**

In this section, you will learn how to perform Geary's c statistics testing by using appropriate functions of **spdep** package.

#### Geary's C test

The code chunk below performs Geary's C test for spatial autocorrelation by using [*geary.test()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/geary.test.html) of **spdep**.

```{r}
geary.test(hunan$GDPPC, listw=rswm_q)
```

**Question:** What statistical conclusion can you draw from the output above?

**Ans:** The small p-value of 0.0001526 suggests that the observed spatial pattern in the **`hunan$GDPPC`** variable, as measured by Geary's C, is statistically significant. The observed Geary's C statistic is significantly lower than what would be expected by random chance alone. This implies positive spatial autocorrelation, meaning similar values are clustered together in space. The conclusion is consistent with the alternative hypothesis that the expected spatial pattern is greater than the observed pattern.

#### Computing Monte Carlo Geary's C

The code chunk below performs permutation test for Geary's C statistic by using [*geary.mc()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/geary.mc.html) of **spdep**.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
bperm=geary.mc(hunan$GDPPC, 
               listw=rswm_q, 
               nsim=999)
bperm
```

**Question:** What statistical conclusion can you draw from the output above?

**Ans:** The p-value of 0.001 is less than the conventional significance level of 0.05. Therefore, you would reject the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation. The results suggest that the observed spatial pattern in the **`hunan$GDPPC`** variable, as measured by Geary's C, is statistically significant and not likely due to random chance. The positive alternative hypothesis indicates that the expected spatial pattern is greater than the observed pattern, implying positive spatial autocorrelation.

#### Visualising the Monte Carlo Geary's C

Next, we will plot a histogram to reveal the distribution of the simulated values by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
mean(bperm$res[1:999])
```

```{r}
var(bperm$res[1:999])
```

```{r}
summary(bperm$res[1:999])
```

```{r}
hist(bperm$res, freq=TRUE, breaks=20, xlab="Simulated Geary c")
abline(v=1, col="red") 
```

**Question:** What statistical observation can you draw from the output?

**Ans:**

-   The mean being close to the expected value (1.0) under the null hypothesis suggests that the simulation process is generating Geary's C values consistent with spatial randomness.

-   The histogram shows that Geary's C values approximates a normal distribution.

## **Spatial Correlogram**

Spatial correlograms are great to examine patterns of spatial autocorrelation in your data or model residuals. They show how correlated are pairs of spatial observations when you increase the distance (lag) between them - they are plots of some index of autocorrelation (Moran's I or Geary's c) against distance.Although correlograms are not as fundamental as variograms (a keystone concept of geostatistics), they are very useful as an exploratory and descriptive tool. For this purpose they actually provide richer information than variograms.

### **Compute Moran's I correlogram**

In the code chunk below, [*sp.correlogram()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/sp.correlogram.html) of **spdep** package is used to compute a 6-lag spatial correlogram of GDPPC. The global spatial autocorrelation used in Moran's I. The **plot()** of base Graph is then used to plot the output.

```{r}
MI_corr <- sp.correlogram(wm_q, 
                          hunan$GDPPC, 
                          order=6, 
                          method="I", 
                          style="W")
plot(MI_corr)
```

By plotting the output might not allow us to provide complete interpretation. This is because not all autocorrelation values are statistically significant. Hence, it is important for us to examine the full analysis report by printing out the analysis results as in the code chunk below.

```{r}
print(MI_corr)
```

**Question:** What statistical observation can you draw from the plot above?

**Ans:**

-   Lag 1, 2, 5 have highly significant Moran's I values (indicated by '\*\*\*'), suggesting significant spatial autocorrelation.

-   Lag 4 has a p-value of 0.226015, which is not significant at conventional levels (0.05).

### **Compute Geary's C correlogram and plot**

In the code chunk below, *sp.correlogram()* of **spdep** package is used to compute a 6-lag spatial correlogram of GDPPC. The global spatial autocorrelation used in Geary's C. The **plot()** of base Graph is then used to plot the output.

```{r}
GC_corr <- sp.correlogram(wm_q, 
                          hunan$GDPPC, 
                          order=6, 
                          method="C", 
                          style="W")
plot(GC_corr)
```

Similar to the previous step, we will print out the analysis report by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
print(GC_corr)
```
