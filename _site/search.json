    "section": "14 Calibrating Spatial Interaction Models",
    "text": "14 Calibrating Spatial Interaction Models\nIn this section, I will calibrate Spatial Interaction Models by using log based Poisson Regression Gravity Model using glm() function. Ther e are 4 components in the models:\n\nNumber of Trips (MORNING_PEAK), as the target variable of the model\nDistance. The underlying idea is that the longer the distance, the less appealing the journey is.\nAttractiveness Variables, as factors that lead bus passengers to disembark at particular bus stop\nPropulsiveness Variables, as factors that lead bus passengers to board from particular bus stop\n\nThere are several reasons why Poisson Regression is chosen as follows:\n\nMy dependent variable , MORNING_PEAK represent count of trips making it suitable for a count-base model like Poisson Regression which is a type of generalised linear model (GLM) designed for count data\nMy dependent variables only takes positive values and the concept of negative counts is not meaning, so Poisson regression is preferable over linear regression which allows for negative values.\nthe choice of Poisson regression is supported by the consideration that residuals may exhibit an asymmetric distribution around the mean. In other words, outcomes on either side of the mean are not equally likely, emphasizing the need for a model that accommodates such characteristics. Therefore, Poisson regression emerges as a sensible and statistically appropriate choice for capturing the unique nature of our count-based and positively constrained MORNIGN_PEAK variable.\n\n\n14.1 Importing the Modelling Data\nFirst, I will import the flow_data_tidy back into R.\n\nflow_data_tidy &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/flow_data_tidy.rds\")\n\n\n\n14.2 Visualising the Dependent Variables\n\n14.2.1 Distribution of Weekends/Holiday Morning Peak Trips\n\nggplot(data = flow_data_tidy,\n       aes(x = MORNING_PEAK)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill=\"lightblue\")+\n  labs(y= \"Count of Trips\", x= \"Trips\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Weekends/Holiday Morning Peak Trips\")\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above plot, it is noted that the distribution of weekends/holiday morning peak hour is highly skewed to the right.\nNext, I will visualize the relation between dependent variable and one of the key independent variable in Spatial Interaction Model which is distance\n\n\n14.2.2 Trips vs Distance\n\nggplot(data = flow_data_tidy,\n       aes(x = dist,\n           y = MORNING_PEAK)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm)+\n  labs(y= 'MORNING_PEAK', x='dist') +\n  ggtitle('Relationship between MORNING_PEAK Trips and Distance')\n\n\n\n\nIt is noticed that the relationship hardly resemble linear relationship. I will try to plot the scatter plot again using the log transformed of both variables and whether I can get a more linear relationship.\n\n\n14.2.3 Log(Morning Peak Trips) vs Log(Distance)\n\nggplot(data = flow_data_tidy,\n       aes(x = log(dist),\n           y = log(MORNING_PEAK))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm)+\n  labs(y= 'log(MORNING_PEAK)', x='log(dist)') +\n  ggtitle('Relationship between log(MORNING_PEAK Trips) and log(Distance)')\n\n\n\n\nFrom the scatter plot above, I can see that the relationship is more resemble linear relationship.\n\n\n\n14.3 Checking for Variables with Zero Values\nSince Poisson Regression is based on log and log 0 is undefined, it is important to ensure that there are no 0 value in the explanatory variables.\n\nsummary(flow_data_tidy)\n\n ORIGIN_GRID_ID  DESTIN_GRID_ID   MORNING_PEAK          dist      \n 1474   :  319   1474   :  317   Min.   :    1.0   Min.   :  750  \n 1960   :

    "text": "16 Conclusion\nIn conclusion, four Spatial Interaction Model are constructed and compared to identify important factors influencing public bus commuter flow in Weekends/Holiday Morning Peak Hour from 11am to 2pm. The R-squared for unconstrained, origin constrained, destination constrained and doubly constrained are 0.24, 0.52, 0.45, and 0.67 respectively. The RMSE are 459, 365, 392, and 303 respectively. The significant factor for unconstrained and origin constrained, the most influential variables are distance, destination mrt exit count, destination finserv count. While for destination constrained, the most influential variables are distance, origin mrt exit count, origin finserv count and for doubly constrained, it is distance. In summary, for attractiveness and propulsiveness, distance plays a crucial part. It is followed by mrt exit count, an indicative that people use public bus and transfer to/from MRT/LRT. Then, the number of financial service is also important, it may be related to the number of population in which the more financial service/banks in an area, the highly populated the area is and thus the flow of people taking bus are higher."

The most connected area unit has 11 neighbours. There are two area units with only one neighbours.\nFor each polygon in our polygon object, wm_q lists all neighboring polygons. For example, to see the neighbors for the first polygon in the object, type:\n\nwm_q[[1]]\n\n[1]  2  3  4 57 85\n\n\nPolygon 1 has 5 neighbors. The numbers represent the polygon IDs as stored in hunan SpatialPolygonsDataFrame class.\nWe can retrieve the county name of Polygon ID=1 by using the code chunk below:\n\nhunan$County[1]\n\n[1] \"Anxiang\"\n\n\nThe output reveals that Polygon ID=1 is Anxiang county.\nTo reveal the county names of the five neighboring polygons, the code chunk will be used:\n\n#hunan$NAME_3[c(2,3,4,57,85)]\n\nWe can retrieve the GDPPC of these five countries by using the code chunk below.\n\nnb1 &lt;- wm_q[[1]]\nnb1 &lt;- hunan$GDPPC[nb1]\nnb1\n\n[1] 20981 34592 24473 21311 22879\n\n\nThe printed output above shows that the GDPPC of the five nearest neighbours based on Queen’s method are 20981, 34592, 24473, 21311 and 22879 respectively.\nYou can display the complete weight matrix by using str().\n\nstr(wm_q)\n\nList of 88\n $ : int [1:5] 2 3 4 57 85\n $ : int [1:5] 1 57 58 78 85\n $ : int [1:4] 1 4 5 85\n $ : int [1:4] 1 3 5 6\n $ : int [1:4] 3 4 6 85\n $ : int [1:5] 4 5 69 75 85\n $ : int [1:4] 67 71 74 84\n $ : int [1:7] 9 46 47 56 78 80 86\n $ : int [1:6] 8 66 68 78 84 86\n $ : int [1:8] 16 17 19 20 22 70 72 73\n $ : int [1:3] 14 17 72\n $ : int [1:5] 13 60 61 63 83\n $ : int [1:4] 12 15 60 83\n $ : int [1:3] 11 15 17\n $ : int [1:4] 13 14 17 83\n $ : int [1:5] 10 17 22 72 83\n $ : int [1:7] 10 11 14 15 16 72 83\n $ : int [1:5] 20 22 23 77 83\n $ : int [1:6] 10 20 21 73 74 86\n $ : int [1:7] 10 18 19 21 22 23 82\n $ : int [1:5] 19 20 35 82 86\n $ : int [1:5] 10 16 18 20 83\n $ : int [1:7] 18 20 38 41 77 79 82\n $ : int [1:5] 25 28 31 32 54\n $ : int [1:5] 24 28 31 33 81\n $ : int [1:4] 27 33 42 81\n $ : int [1:3] 26 29 42\n $ : int [1:5] 24 25 33 49 54\n $ : int [1:3] 27 37 42\n $ : int 33\n $ : int [1:8] 24 25 32 36 39 40 56 81\n $ : int [1:8] 24 31 50 54 55 56 75 85\n $ : int [1:5] 25 26 28 30 81\n $ : int [1:3] 36 45 80\n $ : int [1:6] 21 41 47 80 82 86\n $ : int [1:6] 31 34 40 45 56 80\n $ : int [1:4] 29 42 43 44\n $ : int [1:4] 23 44 77 79\n $ : int [1:5] 31 40 42 43 81\n $ : int [1:6] 31 36 39 43 45 79\n $ : int [1:6] 23 35 45 79 80 82\n $ : int [1:7] 26 27 29 37 39 43 81\n $ : int [1:6] 37 39 40 42 44 79\n $ : int [1:4] 37 38 43 79\n $ : int [1:6] 34 36 40 41 79 80\n $ : int [1:3] 8 47 86\n $ : int [1:5] 8 35 46 80 86\n $ : int [1:5] 50 51 52 53 55\n $ : int [1:4] 28 51 52 54\n $ : int [1:5] 32 48 52 54 55\n $ : int [1:3] 48 49 52\n $ : int [1:5] 48 49 50 51 54\n $ : int [1:3] 48 55 75\n $ : int [1:6] 24 28 32 49 50 52\n $ : int [1:5] 32 48 50 53 75\n $ : int [1:7] 8 31 32 36 78 80 85\n $ : int [1:6] 1 2 58 64 76 85\n $ : int [1:5] 2 57 68 76 78\n $ : int [1:4] 60 61 87 88\n $ : int [1:4] 12 13 59 61\n $ : int [1:7] 12 59 60 62 63 77 87\n $ : int [1:3] 61 77 87\n $ : int [1:4] 12 61 77 83\n $ : int [1:2] 57 76\n $ : int 76\n $ : int [1:5] 9 67 68 76 84\n $ : int [1:4] 7 66 76 84\n $ : int [1:5] 9 58 66 76 78\n $ : int [1:3] 6 75 85\n $ : int [1:3] 10 72 73\n $ : int [1:3] 7 73 74\n $ : int [1:5] 10 11 16 17 70\n $ : int [1:5] 10 19 70 71 74\n $ : int [1:6] 7 19 71 73 84 86\n $ : int [1:6] 6 32 53 55 69 85\n $ : int [1:7] 57 58 64 65 66 67 68\n $ : int [1:7] 18 23 38 61 62 63 83\n $ : int [1:7] 2 8 9 56 58 68 85\n $ : int [1:7] 23 38 40 41 43 44 45\n $ : int [1:8] 8 34 35 36 41 45 47 56\n $ : int [1:6] 25 26 31 33 39 42\n $ : int [1:5] 20 21 23 35 41\n $ : int [1:9] 12 13 15 16 17 18 22 63 77\n $ : int [1:6] 7 9 66 67 74 86\n $ : int [1:11] 1 2 3 5 6 32 56 57 69 75 ...\n $ : int [1:9] 8 9 19 21 35 46 47 74 84\n $ : int [1:4] 59 61 62 88\n $ : int [1:2] 59 87\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"nb\"\n - attr(*, \"region.id\")= chr [1:88] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" ...\n - attr(*, \"call\")= language poly2nb(pl = hunan, queen = TRUE)\n - attr(*, \"type\")= chr \"queen\"\n - attr(*, \"sym\")= logi TRUE\n\n\nBe warned: The output might cut across several pages.

We are working with polygons at the moment, so we will need to get points in order to make our connectivity graphs. The most typically method for this will be polygon centroids. We will calculate these in the sf package before moving onto the graphs. Getting Latitude and Longitude of Polygon Centroids\nWe will need points to associate with each polygon before we can make our connectivity graph. It will be a little more complicated than just running st_centroid on the sf object: us.bound. We need the coordinates in a separate data frame for this to work. To do this we will use a mapping function. The mapping function applies a given function to each element of a vector and returns a vector of the same length. Our input vector will be the geometry column of us.bound. Our function will be st_centroid. We will be using map_dbl variation of map from the purrr package. For more documentation, check out map documentation\nTo get our longitude values we map the st_centroid function over the geometry column of us.bound and access the longitude value through double bracket notation [[]] and 1. This allows us to get only the longitude, which is the first value in each centroid.\n\nlongitude &lt;- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[1]])\n\nWe do the same for latitude with one key difference. We access the second value per each centroid with [[2]].\n\nlatitude &lt;- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[2]])\n\nNow that we have latitude and longitude, we use cbind to put longitude and latitude into the same object.\n\ncoords &lt;- cbind(longitude, latitude)\n\nWe check the first few observations to see if things are formatted correctly.\n\nhead(coords)\n\n     longitude latitude\n[1,]  112.1531 29.44362\n[2,]  112.0372 28.86489\n[3,]  111.8917 29.47107\n[4,]  111.7031 29.74499\n[5,]  111.6138 29.49258\n[6,]  111.0341 29.79863\n\n\n\n5.3.1 Plotting Queen contiguity based neighbours map\n\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\")\nplot(wm_q, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col= \"red\")\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\npch: plot character (pch=19 means solid circles as plotting symbol)\ncex: character expansion (True: add points to existing plot, FALSE: start a new plot)\n\n\n5.3.2 Plotting Rook contiguity based neighbours map\n\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\")\nplot(wm_r, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Plotting both Queen and Rook contiguity based neighbours maps\n\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\", main=\"Queen Contiguity\")\nplot(wm_q, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col= \"red\")\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\", main=\"Rook Contiguity\")\nplot(wm_r, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col = \"red\")"

    "text": "6 Computing distance based neighbours\nIn this section, you will learn how to derive distance-based weight matrices by using dnearneigh() of spdep package.\nThe function identifies neighbours of region points by Euclidean distance with a distance band with lower d1= and upper d2= bounds controlled by the bounds= argument. If unprojected coordinates are used and either specified in the coordinates object x or with x as a two column matrix and longlat=TRUE, great circle distances in km will be calculated assuming the WGS84 reference ellipsoid.\n\n6.1 Determine the cut-off distance\nFirstly, we need to determine the upper limit for distance band by using the steps below:\n\nReturn a matrix with the indices of points belonging to the set of the k nearest neighbours of each other by using knearneigh() of spdep.\nConvert the knn object returned by knearneigh() into a neighbours list of class nb with a list of integer vectors containing neighbour region number ids by using knn2nb().\nReturn the length of neighbour relationship edges by using nbdists() of spdep. The function returns in the units of the coordinates if the coordinates are projected, in km otherwise.\nRemove the list structure of the returned object by using unlist().\n\n\n#coords &lt;- coordinates(hunan)\nk1 &lt;- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords))\nk1dists &lt;- unlist(nbdists(k1, coords, longlat = TRUE))\nsummary(k1dists)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Having many neighbours smoothes the neighbour relationship across more neighbours.\nIt is possible to control the numbers of neighbours directly using k-nearest neighbours, either accepting asymmetric neighbours or imposing symmetry as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nknn6 &lt;- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k=6))\nknn6\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 528 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 6.818182 \nAverage number of links: 6 \nNon-symmetric neighbours list\n\n\nSimilarly, we can display the content of the matrix by using str().\n\nstr(knn6)\n\nList of 88\n $ : int [1:6] 2 3 4 5 57 64\n $ : int [1:6] 1 3 57 58 78 85\n $ : int [1:6] 1 2 4 5 57 85\n $ : int [1:6] 1 3 5 6 69 85\n $ : int [1:6] 1 3 4 6 69 85\n $ : int [1:6] 3 4 5 69 75 85\n $ : int [1:6] 9 66 67 71 74 84\n $ : int [1:6] 9 46 47 78 80 86\n $ : int [1:6] 8 46 66 68 84 86\n $ : int [1:6] 16 19 22 70 72 73\n $ : int [1:6] 10 14 16 17 70 72\n $ : int [1:6] 13 15 60 61 63 83\n $ : int [1:6] 12 15 60 61 63 83\n $ : int [1:6] 11 15 16 17 72 83\n $ : int [1:6] 12 13 14 17 60 83\n $ : int [1:6] 10 11 17 22 72 83\n $ : int [1:6] 10 11 14 16 72 83\n $ : int [1:6] 20 22 23 63 77 83\n $ : int [1:6] 10 20 21 73 74 82\n $ : int [1:6] 18 19 21 22 23 82\n $ : int [1:6] 19 20 35 74 82 86\n $ : int [1:6] 10 16 18 19 20 83\n $ : int [1:6] 18 20 41 77 79 82\n $ : int [1:6] 25 28 31 52 54 81\n $ : int [1:6] 24 28 31 33 54 81\n $ : int [1:6] 25 27 29 33 42 81\n $ : int [1:6] 26 29 30 37 42 81\n $ : int [1:6] 24 25 33 49 52 54\n $ : int [1:6] 26 27 37 42 43 81\n $ : int [1:6] 26 27 28 33 49 81\n $ : int [1:6] 24 25 36 39 40 54\n $ : int [1:6] 24 31 50 54 55 56\n $ : int [1:6] 25 26 28 30 49 81\n $ : int [1:6] 36 40 41 45 56 80\n $ : int [1:6] 21 41 46 47 80 82\n $ : int [1:6] 31 34 40 45 56 80\n $ : int [1:6] 26 27 29 42 43 44\n $ : int [1:6] 23 43 44 62 77 79\n $ : int [1:6] 25 40 42 43 44 81\n $ : int [1:6] 31 36 39 43 45 79\n $ : int [1:6] 23 35 45 79 80 82\n $ : int [1:6] 26 27 37 39 43 81\n $ : int [1:6] 37 39 40 42 44 79\n $ : int [1:6] 37 38 39 42 43 79\n $ : int [1:6] 34 36 40 41 79 80\n $ : int [1:6] 8 9 35 47 78 86\n $ : int [1:6] 8 21 35 46 80 86\n $ : int [1:6] 49 50 51 52 53 55\n $ : int [1:6] 28 33 48 51 52 54\n $ : int [1:6] 32 48 51 52 54 55\n $ : int [1:6] 28 48 49 50 52 54\n $ : int [1:6] 28 48 49 50 51 54\n $ : int [1:6] 48 50 51 52 55 75\n $ : int [1:6] 24 28 49 50 51 52\n $ : int [1:6] 32 48 50 52 53 75\n $ : int [1:6] 32 34 36 78 80 85\n $ : int [1:6] 1 2 3 58 64 68\n $ : int [1:6] 2 57 64 66 68 78\n $ : int [1:6] 12 13 60 61 87 88\n $ : int [1:6] 12 13 59 61 63 87\n $ : int [1:6] 12 13 60 62 63 87\n $ : int [1:6] 12 38 61 63 77 87\n $ : int [1:6] 12 18 60 61 62 83\n $ : int [1:6] 1 3 57 58 68 76\n $ : int [1:6] 58 64 66 67 68 76\n $ : int [1:6] 9 58 67 68 76 84\n $ : int [1:6] 7 65 66 68 76 84\n $ : int [1:6] 9 57 58 66 78 84\n $ : int [1:6] 4 5 6 32 75 85\n $ : int [1:6] 10 16 19 22 72 73\n $ : int [1:6] 7 19 73 74 84 86\n $ : int [1:6] 10 11 14 16 17 70\n $ : int [1:6] 10 19 21 70 71 74\n $ : int [1:6] 19 21 71 73 84 86\n $ : int [1:6] 6 32 50 53 55 69\n $ : int [1:6] 58 64 65 66 67 68\n $ : int [1:6] 18 23 38 61 62 63\n $ : int [1:6] 2 8 9 46 58 68\n $ : int [1:6] 38 40 41 43 44 45\n $ : int [1:6] 34 35 36 41 45 47\n $ : int [1:6] 25 26 28 33 39 42\n $ : int [1:6] 19 20 21 23 35 41\n $ : int [1:6] 12 13 15 16 22 63\n $ : int [1:6] 7 9 66 68 71 74\n $ : int [1:6] 2 3 4 5 56 69\n $ : int [1:6] 8 9 21 46 47 74\n $ : int [1:6] 59 60 61 62 63 88\n $ : int [1:6] 59 60 61 62 63 87\n - attr(*, \"region.id\")= chr [1:88] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" ...\n - attr(*, \"call\")= language knearneigh(x = coords, k = 6)\n - attr(*, \"sym\")= logi FALSE\n - attr(*, \"type\")= chr \"knn\"\n - attr(*, \"knn-k\")= num 6\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"nb\"\n\n\nNotice that each county has six neighbours, no less no more!\n\n6.3.1 Plotting distance based neighbours\nWe can plot the weight matrix using the code chunk below.\n\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\")\nplot(knn6, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col = \"red\")"

In our case, each neighboring polygon will be assigned equal weight (style=“W”). This is accomplished by assigning the fraction 1/(#ofneighbors) to each neighboring county then summing the weighted income values. While this is the most intuitive way to summaries the neighbors’ values it has one drawback in that polygons along the edges of the study area will base their lagged values on fewer polygons thus potentially over- or under-estimating the true nature of the spatial autocorrelation in the data. For this example, we’ll stick with the style=“W” option for simplicity’s sake but note that other more robust options are available, notably style=“B”.\n\nrswm_q &lt;- nb2listw(wm_q, style=\"W\", zero.policy = TRUE)\nrswm_q\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \n\nWeights style: W \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn S0       S1       S2\nW 88 7744 88 37.86334 365.9147\n\n\nThe zero.policy=TRUE option allows for lists of non-neighbors. This should be used with caution since the user may not be aware of missing neighbors in their dataset however, a zero.policy of FALSE would return an error.\nTo see the weight of the first polygon’s eight neighbors type:\n\nrswm_q$weights[10]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 0.125 0.125 0.125 0.125 0.125 0.125 0.125 0.125\n\n\nEach neighbor is assigned a 0.125 of the total weight. This means that when R computes the average neighboring income values, each neighbor’s income will be multiplied by 0.125 before being tallied.\nUsing the same method, we can also derive a row standardised distance weight matrix by using the code chunk below.\n\nrswm_ids &lt;- nb2listw(wm_q, glist=ids, style=\"B\", zero.policy=TRUE)\nrswm_ids\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \n\nWeights style: B \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn       S0        S1     S2\nB 88 7744 8.786867 0.3776535 3.8137\n\n\n\nrswm_ids$weights[1]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 0.01535405 0.03916350 0.01820896 0.02807922 0.01145113\n\n\n\nsummary(unlist(rswm_ids$weights))\n\n    Min.  1st Qu.

This requires us to go back to our neighbors list, then apply a function that will assign binary weights, then we use glist = in the nb2listw function to explicitly assign these weights.\nWe start by applying a function that will assign a value of 1 per each neighbor. This is done with lapply, which we have been using to manipulate the neighbors structure throughout the past notebooks. Basically it applies a function across each value in the neighbors structure.\n\nb_weights &lt;- lapply(wm_q, function(x) 0*x + 1)\nb_weights2 &lt;- nb2listw(wm_q, \n                       glist = b_weights, \n                       style = \"B\")\nb_weights2\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \n\nWeights style: B \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn  S0  S1    S2\nB 88 7744 448 896 10224\n\n\nWith the proper weights assigned, we can use lag.listw to compute a lag variable from our weight and GDPPC.\n\nlag_sum &lt;- list(hunan$NAME_3, lag.listw(b_weights2, hunan$GDPPC))\nlag.res &lt;- as.data.frame(lag_sum)\ncolnames(lag.res) &lt;- c(\"NAME_3\", \"lag_sum GDPPC\")\n\nFirst, let us examine the result by using the code chunk below.\n\nlag_sum\n\n[[1]]\n [1] \"Anxiang\"       \"Hanshou\"       \"Jinshi\"        \"Li\"           \n [5] \"Linli\"         \"Shimen\"        \"Liuyang\"       \"Ningxiang\"    \n [9] \"Wangcheng\"     \"Anren\"         \"Guidong\"       \"Jiahe\"        \n[13] \"Linwu\"         \"Rucheng\"       \"Yizhang\"       \"Yongxing\"     \n[17] \"Zixing\"        \"Changning\"     \"Hengdong\"      \"Hengnan\"      \n[21] \"Hengshan\"      \"Leiyang\"       \"Qidong\"        \"Chenxi\"       \n[25] \"Zhongfang\"     \"Huitong\"       \"Jingzhou\"      \"Mayang\"       \n[29] \"Tongdao\"       \"Xinhuang\"      \"Xupu\"          \"Yuanling\"     \n[33] \"Zhijiang\"      \"Lengshuijiang\" \"Shuangfeng\"    \"Xinhua\"       \n[37] \"Chengbu\"       \"Dongan\"        \"Dongkou\"       \"Longhui\"      \n[41] \"Shaodong\"      \"Suining\"       \"Wugang\"        \"Xinning\"      \n[45] \"Xinshao\"       \"Shaoshan\"      \"Xiangxiang\"    \"Baojing\"      \n[49] \"Fenghuang\"     \"Guzhang\"       \"Huayuan\"       \"Jishou\"       \n[53] \"Longshan\"      \"Luxi\"          \"Yongshun\"      \"Anhua\"        \n[57] \"Nan\"           \"Yuanjiang\"     \"Jianghua\"      \"Lanshan\"      \n[61] \"Ningyuan\"      \"Shuangpai\"     \"Xintian\"       \"Huarong\"      \n[65] \"Linxiang\"      \"Miluo\"         \"Pingjiang\"     \"Xiangyin\"     \n[69] \"Cili\"          \"Chaling\"       \"Liling\"        \"Yanling\"      \n[73] \"You\"           \"Zhuzhou\"       \"Sangzhi\"       \"Yueyang\"      \n[77] \"Qiyang\"        \"Taojiang\"      \"Shaoyang\"      \"Lianyuan\"     \n[81] \"Hongjiang\"     \"Hengyang\"      \"Guiyang\"       \"Changsha\"     \n[85] \"Taoyuan\"       \"Xiangtan\"      \"Dao\"           \"Jiangyong\"    \n\n[[2]]\n [1] 124236 113624  96573 110950 109081 106244 174988 235079 273907 256221\n[11]  98013 104050 102846  92017 133831 158446 141883 119508 150757 153324\n[21] 113593 129594 142149 100119  82884  74668  43184  99244  46549  20518\n[31] 140576 121601  92069  43258 144567 132119  51694  59024  69349  73780\n[41]  94651 100680  69398  52798 140472 118623 180933  82798  83090  97356\n[51]  59482  77334  38777 111463  74715 174391 150558 122144  68012  84575\n[61] 143045  51394  98279  47671  26360 236917 220631 185290  64640  70046\n[71] 126971 144693 129404 284074 112268 203611 145238 251536 108078 238300\n[81] 108870 108085 262835 248182 244850 404456  67608  33860\n\n\nQuestion: Can you understand the meaning of Spatial lag as a sum of neighboring values now?\nAns: Yes, this provides a measure of spatial dependence, indicating how the GDPPC values in each region are related to the sum of GDPPC values in neighboring regions.\nNext, we will append the lag_sum GDPPC field into hunan sf data frame by using the code chunk below.\n\nhunan &lt;- left_join(hunan, lag.res)\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(NAME_3)`\n\n\nNow, We can plot both the GDPPC and Spatial Lag Sum GDPPC for comparison using the code chunk below.\n\ngdppc &lt;- qtm(hunan, \"GDPPC\")\nlag_sum_gdppc &lt;- qtm(hunan, \"lag_sum GDPPC\")\ntmap_arrange(gdppc, lag_sum_gdppc, asp=1, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3 Spatial window average\nThe spatial window average uses row-standardized weights and includes the diagonal element. To do this in R, we need to go back to the neighbors structure and add the diagonal element before assigning weights.\nTo add the diagonal element to the neighbour list, we just need to use include.self() from spdep.\n\nwm_qs &lt;- include.self(wm_q)\n\nNotice that the Number of nonzero links, Percentage nonzero weights and Average number of links are 536, 6.921488 and 6.090909 respectively as compared to wm_q of 448, 5.785124 and 5.090909\nLet us take a good look at the neighbour list of area [1] by using the code chunk below.\n\nwm_qs[[1]]\n\n[1]  1  2  3  4 57 85\n\n\nNotice that now [1] has six neighbours instead of five.\nNow we obtain weights with nb2listw()\n\nwm_qs &lt;- nb2listw(wm_qs)\nwm_qs\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list

      S1       S2\nW 88 7744 88 30.90265 357.5308\n\n\nAgain, we use nb2listw() and glist() to explicitly assign weight values.\nLastly, we just need to create the lag variable from our weight structure and GDPPC variable.\n\nlag_w_avg_gpdpc &lt;- lag.listw(wm_qs, \n                             hunan$GDPPC)\nlag_w_avg_gpdpc\n\n [1] 24650.50 22434.17 26233.00 27084.60 26927.00 22230.17

It can be downloaded at data.gov.sg This is a geospatial data. It consists of the geographical boundary of Singapore at the planning subzone level. The data is based on URA Master Plan 2014.\nSingapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2011-2020 in csv format (i.e. respopagesextod2011to2020.csv). This is an aspatial data fie.

This is because the values of PA and SZ fields are made up of upper- and lowercase. On the other, hand the SUBZONE_N and PLN_AREA_N are in uppercase.\n\npopdata2020 &lt;- popdata2020 %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(.vars = vars(PA, SZ), \n          .funs = funs(toupper)) %&gt;%\n  filter(`ECONOMY ACTIVE` &gt; 0)\n\nNext, left_join() of dplyr is used to join the geographical data and attribute table using planning subzone name e.g. SUBZONE_N and SZ as the common identifier.\n\nmpsz_pop2020 &lt;- left_join(mpsz, popdata2020,\n                          by = c(\"SUBZONE_N\" = \"SZ\"))\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nleft_join() of dplyr package is used with mpsz simple feature data frame as the left data table is to ensure that the output will be a simple features data frame.\n\n\nwrite_rds(mpsz_pop2020, \"data/rds/mpszpop2020.rds\")"

    "text": "4 Choropleth Mapping Geospatial Data Using tmap\nTwo approaches can be used to prepare thematic map using tmap, they are:\n\nPlotting a thematic map quickly by using qtm().\nPlotting highly customisable thematic map by using tmap elements.\n\n\n4.1 Plotting a choropleth map quickly by using qtm()\nThe easiest and quickest to draw a choropleth map using tmap is using qtm(). It is concise and provides a good default visualisation in many cases.\nThe code chunk below will draw a cartographic standard choropleth map as shown below.\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\nqtm(mpsz_pop2020, \n    fill = \"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Things to learn from the code chunk above:\n\ntmap_mode() with “plot” option is used to produce a static map. For interactive mode, “view” option should be used.\nfill argument is used to map the attribute (i.e. DEPENDENCY)Creating a choropleth map by using tmap’s elements\n\n\n\n4.3 Data classification methods of tmap\nDespite its usefulness of drawing a choropleth map quickly and easily, the disadvantge of qtm() is that it makes aesthetics of individual layers harder to control. To draw a high quality cartographic choropleth map as shown in the figure below, tmap’s drawing elements should be used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          title = \"Dependency ratio\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_compass(type=\"8star\", size = 2) +\n  tm_scale_bar() +\n  tm_grid(alpha =0.2) +\n  tm_credits(\"Source: Planning Sub-zone boundary from Urban Redevelopment Authorithy (URA)\\n and Population data from Department of Statistics DOS\", \n             position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\nIn the following sub-section, we will share with you tmap functions that used to plot these elements.\n\n4.3.1 Drawing a base map\nThe basic building block of tmap is tm_shape() followed by one or more layer elemments such as tm_fill() and tm_polygons().\nIn the code chunk below, tm_shape() is used to define the input data (i.e mpsz_pop2020) and tm_polygons() is used to draw the planning subzone polygons\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Drawing a choropleth map using tm_polygons()\nTo draw a choropleth map showing the geographical distribution of a selected variable by planning subzone, we just need to assign the target variable such as Dependency to tm_polygons().\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_polygons(\"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from tm_polygons():\n\nThe default interval binning used to draw the choropleth map is called “pretty”. A detailed discussion of the data classification methods supported by tmap will be provided in sub-section 4.3.\nThe default colour scheme used is YlOrRd of ColorBrewer. You will learn more about the color scheme in sub-section 4.4.\nBy default, Missing value will be shaded in grey.\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Drawing a choropleth map using tm_fill() and *tm_border()**\nActually, tm_polygons() is a wraper of tm_fill() and tm_border(). tm_fill() shades the polygons by using the default colour scheme and tm_borders() adds the borders of the shapefile onto the choropleth map.\nThe code chunk below draws a choropleth map by using tm_fill() alone.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the planning subzones are shared according to the respective dependecy values\nTo add the boundary of the planning subzones, tm_borders will be used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\") +\n  tm_borders(lwd = 0.1,  alpha = 1)\n\n\n\n\nNotice that light-gray border lines have been added on the choropleth map.\nThe alpha argument is used to define transparency number between 0 (totally transparent) and 1 (not transparent). By default, the alpha value of the col is used (normally 1).\nBeside alpha argument, there are three other arguments for tm_borders(), they are:\n\ncol = border colour,\nlwd = border line width. The default is 1, and\nlty = border line type. The default is “solid”.\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Data classification methods of tmap\nMost choropleth maps employ some methods of data classification. The point of classification is to take a large number of observations and group them into data ranges or classes.\ntmap provides a total ten data classification methods, namely: fixed, sd, equal, pretty (default), quantile, kmeans, hclust, bclust, fisher, and jenks.\nTo define a data classification method, the style argument of tm_fill() or tm_polygons() will be used.\n\n4.4.1 Plotting choropleth maps with built-in classification methods\nThe code chunk below shows a quantile data classification that used 5 classes.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"jenks\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, equal data classification method is used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"equal\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the distribution of quantile data classification method are more evenly distributed then equal data classification method.\n\nDIY: Using what you had learned, prepare choropleth maps by using different classification methods supported by tmap and compare their differences.\n\nIn the code chunk below, pretty break data classification method is used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"pretty\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the distribution of pretty break data classification method are very similar with equal data classification method, but using pretty break there are only 4 classes as the the function pretty prioritizes creating breaks at “nice” values that are easy to read on plots(visually appealing).\n\nDIY: Preparing choropleth maps by using similar classification method but with different numbers of classes (i.e. 2, 6, 10, 20). Compare the output maps, what observation can you draw?\n\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 2,\n          style = \"jenks\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 6,\n          style = \"jenks\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 10,\n          style = \"jenks\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 20,\n          style = \"jenks\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\nThe choice of the number of classes significantly influences how the data is visualized and how patterns are perceived:\n\n2 classes: This can result in a binary representation where only high and low values are distinguished. It might oversimplify the data, potentially masking subtle variations within each class.\n5 and 6 classes : This result provides a balanced representation of the data. It allows for a moderate level of detail without overwhelming the viewer.\n10 and 20 classes: Too many classes can result in a visually cluttered map, making it difficult for viewers to discern meaningful patterns.\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Plotting choropleth map with custome break\nFor all the built-in styles, the category breaks are computed internally. In order to override these defaults, the breakpoints can be set explicitly by means of the breaks argument to the tm_fill(). It is important to note that, in tmap the breaks include a minimum and maximum. As a result, in order to end up with n categories, n+1 elements must be specified in the breaks option (the values must be in increasing order).\nBefore we get started, it is always a good practice to get some descriptive statistics on the variable before setting the break points. Code chunk below will be used to compute and display the descriptive statistics of DEPENDENCY field.\n\nsummary(mpsz_pop2020$DEPENDENCY)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n 0.0000  0.7113  0.7926  0.8561  0.8786 19.0000      92 \n\n\nWith reference to the results above, we set break point at 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, and 0.90. In addition, we also need to include a minimum and maximum, which we set at 0 and 100. Our breaks vector is thus c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)\nNow, we will plot the choropleth map by using the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          breaks = c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Colour Scheme\ntmap supports colour ramps either defined by the user or a set of predefined colour ramps from the RColorBrewer package.\n\n4.5.1 Using ColourBrewer palette\nTo change the colour, we assign the preferred colour to palette argument of tm_fill() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 6,\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the choropleth map is shaded in green.\nTo reverse the colour shading, add a “-” prefix.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"-Greens\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the colour scheme has been reversed.\n\n\n\n4.6 Map Layouts\nMap layout refers to the combination of all map elements into a cohensive map. Map elements include among others the objects to be mapped, the title, the scale bar, the compass, margins and aspects ratios. Colour settings and data classification methods covered in the previous section relate to the palette and break-points are used to affect how the map looks.\n\n4.6.1 Map Legend\nIn tmap, several legend options are provided to change the placement, format and appearance of the legend.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"jenks\", \n          palette = \"Blues\", \n          legend.hist = TRUE, \n          legend.is.portrait = TRUE,\n          legend.hist.z = 0.1) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone \\n(Jenks classification)\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            legend.outside = FALSE,\n            legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"),\n            frame = FALSE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6.2 Map style\ntmap allows a wide variety of layout settings to be changed. They can be called by using tmap_style().\nThe code chunk below shows the classic style is used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"-Greens\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tmap_style(\"classic\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6.3 Cartographic Furniture\nBeside map style, tmap also also provides arguments to draw other map furniture such as compass, scale bar and grid lines.\nIn the code chunk below, tm_compass(), tm_scale_bar() and tm_grid() are used to add compass, scale bar and grid lines onto the choropleth map.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          title = \"No. of persons\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio \\nby planning subzone\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_compass(type=\"8star\", size = 2) +\n  tm_scale_bar(width = 0.15) +\n  tm_grid(lwd = 0.1, alpha = 0.2) +\n  tm_credits(\"Source: Planning Sub-zone boundary from Urban Redevelopment Authorithy (URA)\\n and Population data from Department of Statistics DOS\", \n             position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\nTo reset the default style, refer to the code chunk below.\n\ntmap_style(\"white\")\n\n\n\n\n4.7 Drawing Small Multiple Choropleth Maps\nSmall multiple maps, also referred to as facet maps, are composed of many maps arrange side-by-side, and sometimes stacked vertically. Small multiple maps enable the visualisation of how spatial relationships change with respect to another variable, such as time.\nIn tmap, small multiple maps can be plotted in three ways:\n\nby assigning multiple values to at least one of the asthetic arguments,\nby defining a group-by variable in tm_facets(), and\nby creating multiple stand-alone maps with tmap_arrange().\n\n\n4.7.1 By assigning multiple values to at least one of the aesthetic arguments\nIn this example, small multiple choropleth maps are created by defining ncols in tm_fill()\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(c(\"YOUNG\", \"AGED\"),\n          style = \"equal\", \n          palette = \"Blues\") +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\")) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tmap_style(\"white\")\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, small multiple choropleth maps are created by assigning multiple values to at least one of the aesthetic arguments\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ \n  tm_polygons(c(\"DEPENDENCY\",\"AGED\"),\n          style = c(\"equal\", \"quantile\"), \n          palette = list(\"Blues\",\"Greens\")) +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.7.2 By defining a group-by variable in tm_facets()\nIn this example, multiple small choropleth maps are created by using tm_facets().\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          thres.poly = 0) + \n  tm_facets(by=\"REGION_N\", \n            free.coords=TRUE, \n            drop.shapes=TRUE) +\n  tm_layout(legend.show = FALSE,\n            title.position = c(\"center\", \"center\"), \n            title.size = 20) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.7.3 By creating multiple stand-alone maps with tmap_arrange()\nIn this example, multiple small choropleth maps are created by creating multiple stand-alone maps with tmap_arrange().\n\nyoungmap &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ \n  tm_polygons(\"YOUNG\", \n              style = \"quantile\", \n              palette = \"Blues\")\n\nagedmap &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ \n  tm_polygons(\"AGED\", \n              style = \"quantile\", \n              palette = \"Blues\")\n\ntmap_arrange(youngmap, agedmap, asp=1, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.8 Mappping Spatial Object Meeting a Selection Criterion\nInstead of creating small multiple choropleth map, you can also use selection funtion to map spatial objects meeting the selection criterion.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020[mpsz_pop2020$REGION_N==\"CENTRAL REGION\", ])+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"Blues\", \n          legend.hist = TRUE, \n          legend.is.portrait = TRUE,\n          legend.hist.z = 0.1) +\n  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 5.0,\n            legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"),\n            frame = FALSE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)"

    "text": "4 Global Spatial Autocorrelation\nIn this section, you will learn how to compute global spatial autocorrelation statistics and to perform spatial complete randomness test for global spatial autocorrelation.\n\n4.1 Computing Contiguity Spatial Weights\nBefore we can compute the global spatial autocorrelation statistics, we need to construct a spatial weights of the study area. The spatial weights is used to define the neighbourhood relationships between the geographical units (i.e. county) in the study area.\nIn the code chunk below, poly2nb() of spdep package is used to compute contiguity weight matrices for the study area. This function builds a neighbours list based on regions with contiguous boundaries. If you look at the documentation you will see that you can pass a “queen” argument that takes TRUE or FALSE as options. If you do not specify this argument the default is set to TRUE, that is, if you don’t specify queen = FALSE this function will return a list of first order neighbours using the Queen criteria.\nMore specifically, the code chunk below is used to compute Queen contiguity weight matrix.\n\nwm_q &lt;- poly2nb(hunan, \n                queen=TRUE)\nsummary(wm_q)\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \nLink number distribution:\n\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 11 \n 2  2 12 16 24 14 11  4  2  1 \n2 least connected regions:\n30 65 with 1 link\n1 most connected region:\n85 with 11 links\n\n\nThe summary report above shows that there are 88 area units in Hunan. The most connected area unit has 11 neighbours. There are two area units with only one neighbours.\n\n\n4.2 Row-standardised weights matrix\nNext, we need to assign weights to each neighboring polygon. In our case, each neighboring polygon will be assigned equal weight (style=“W”). This is accomplished by assigning the fraction 1/(#ofneighbors) to each neighboring county then summing the weighted income values. While this is the most intuitive way to summaries the neighbors’ values it has one drawback in that polygons along the edges of the study area will base their lagged values on fewer polygons thus potentially over- or under-estimating the true nature of the spatial autocorrelation in the data. For this example, we’ll stick with the style=“W” option for simplicity’s sake but note that other more robust options are available, notably style=“B”.\n\nrswm_q &lt;- nb2listw(wm_q, \n                   style=\"W\", \n                   zero.policy = TRUE)\nrswm_q\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \n\nWeights style: W \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn S0       S1       S2\nW 88 7744 88 37.86334 365.9147\n\n\nThe input of nb2listw() must be an object of class nb. The syntax of the function has two major arguments, namely style and zero.poly.\n\nstyle can take values “W”, “B”, “C”, “U”, “minmax” and “S”. B is the basic binary coding, W is row standardised (sums over all links to n), C is globally standardised (sums over all links to n), U is equal to C divided by the number of neighbours (sums over all links to unity), while S is the variance-stabilizing coding scheme proposed by Tiefelsdorf et al. 1999, p. 167-168 (sums over all links to n).\nIf zero policy is set to TRUE, weights vectors of zero length are inserted for regions without neighbour in the neighbours list. These will in turn generate lag values of zero, equivalent to the sum of products of the zero row t(rep(0, length=length(neighbours))) %*% x, for arbitrary numerical vector x of length length(neighbours). The spatially lagged value of x for the zero-neighbour region will then be zero, which may (or may not) be a sensible choice.\n\n\n\n4.3 Global Spatial Autocorrelation: Moran’s I\nIn this section, you will learn how to perform Moran’s I statistics testing by using moran.test() of spdep.\n\n\n4.4 Maron’s I test\nThe code chunk below performs Moran’s I statistical testing using moran.test() of spdep.\n\nmoran.test(hunan$GDPPC, \n           listw=rswm_q, \n           zero.policy = TRUE, \n           na.action=na.omit)\n\n\n    Moran I test under randomisation\n\ndata:  hunan$GDPPC  \nweights: rswm_q    \n\nMoran I statistic standard deviate = 4.7351, p-value = 1.095e-06\nalternative hypothesis: greater\nsample estimates:\nMoran I statistic       Expectation          Variance \n      0.300749970      -0.011494253       0.004348351 \n\n\nQuestion: What statistical conclusion can you draw from the output above?\nAns:\nH0: The GDPPC values are randomly distributed across Hunan following a completely random process\nThe small p-value and the positive Moran’s I statistic suggest that there is significant positive spatial autocorrelation in the hunan$GDPPC variable based on the provided spatial weights matrix. In other words, regions with similar GDPPC values tend to be spatially clustered in this dataset. The observed spatial pattern is unlikely to occur by random chance alone.\nNote: It implements a two-sided test as opposed to the one-sided test adopted in the above example (i.e. alternative = \"greater\"). A two-sided p-value is nothing more than twice the one-sided p-value. However, there is no important distinction in any of the documentation provided. Fortunately, the GDPPC value is so strongly clustered that both a one-sided and two-sided test produce the same outcome (a p-value close to 0).\n\n4.4.1 Computing Monte Carlo Moran’s I\nThe code chunk below performs permutation test for Moran’s I statistic by using moran.mc() of spdep. A total of 1000 simulation will be performed.\n\nset.seed(1234)\nbperm= moran.mc(hunan$GDPPC, \n                listw=rswm_q, \n                nsim=999, \n                zero.policy = TRUE, \n                na.action=na.omit)\nbperm\n\n\n    Monte-Carlo simulation of Moran I\n\ndata:  hunan$GDPPC \nweights: rswm_q  \nnumber of simulations + 1: 1000 \n\nstatistic = 0.30075, observed rank = 1000, p-value = 0.001\nalternative hypothesis: greater\n\n\nQuestion: What statistical conclustion can you draw fro mthe output above?\nAns: The p-value of 0.001 is less than the conventional significance level of 0.05. Therefore, you would reject the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation. The results suggest that the observed spatial pattern in the hunan$GDPPC variable, as measured by Moran’s I, is statistically significant and not likely due to random chance. The positive Moran’s I value indicates positive spatial autocorrelation, meaning similar values are spatially clustered in the dataset.\n\n\n4.4.2 Visualising Monte Carlo Moran’s I\nIt is always a good practice for us the examine the simulated Moran’s I test statistics in greater detail. This can be achieved by plotting the distribution of the statistical values as a histogram by using the code chunk below.\nIn the code chunk below hist() and abline() of R Graphics are used.\n\nmean(bperm$res[1:999])\n\n[1] -0.01504572\n\n\n\nvar(bperm$res[1:999])\n\n[1] 0.004371574\n\n\n\nsummary(bperm$res[1:999])\n\n    Min.  1st Qu.   Median     Mean  3rd Qu.     Max. \n-0.18339 -0.06168 -0.02125 -0.01505  0.02611  0.27593 \n\n\n\nhist(bperm$res, \n     freq=TRUE, \n     breaks=20, \n     xlab=\"Simulated Moran's I\")\nabline(v=0, \n       col=\"red\") \n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: What statistical observation can you draw from the output above?\nAns:\n\nThe distribution of simulated Moran’s I values under the null hypothesis provides a reference for what you would expect if spatial autocorrelation were due to random chance.\nThe observed Moran’s I value from the original data falls to the right of the distribution, indicating that the observed spatial autocorrelation is higher than what would be expected by random chance.\nThe summary statistics and histogram support the conclusion drawn from the p-value in the previous analysis. The distribution of simulated Moran’s I values suggests that the observed Moran’s I from the original data is statistically significant and unlikely to be due to random chance. The positive skewness implies that positive spatial autocorrelation is less common under the null hypothesis than would be expected by chance.\n\n\n\nChallenge: Instead of using Base Graph to plot the values, plot the values by using ggplot2 package.\n\n\n# Create a data frame for the simulated Moran's I values\nsim_data &lt;- data.frame(Moran_I = bperm$res)\n\n# Plot the histogram using ggplot2\nggplot(sim_data, aes(x = Moran_I)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.02, fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Simulated Moran's I\",\n       x = \"Simulated Moran's I\",\n       y = \"Frequency\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Global Spatial Autocorrelation: Geary’s\nIn this section, you will learn how to perform Geary’s c statistics testing by using appropriate functions of spdep package.\n\n4.5.1 Geary’s C test\nThe code chunk below performs Geary’s C test for spatial autocorrelation by using geary.test() of spdep.\n\ngeary.test(hunan$GDPPC, listw=rswm_q)\n\n\n    Geary C test under randomisation\n\ndata:  hunan$GDPPC \nweights: rswm_q \n\nGeary C statistic standard deviate = 3.6108, p-value = 0.0001526\nalternative hypothesis: Expectation greater than statistic\nsample estimates:\nGeary C statistic       Expectation          Variance \n        0.6907223         1.0000000         0.0073364 \n\n\nQuestion: What statistical conclusion can you draw from the output above?\nAns: The small p-value of 0.0001526 suggests that the observed spatial pattern in the hunan$GDPPC variable, as measured by Geary’s C, is statistically significant. The observed Geary’s C statistic is significantly lower than what would be expected by random chance alone. This implies positive spatial autocorrelation, meaning similar values are clustered together in space. The conclusion is consistent with the alternative hypothesis that the expected spatial pattern is greater than the observed pattern.\n\n\n4.5.2 Computing Monte Carlo Geary’s C\nThe code chunk below performs permutation test for Geary’s C statistic by using geary.mc() of spdep.\n\nset.seed(1234)\nbperm=geary.mc(hunan$GDPPC, \n               listw=rswm_q, \n               nsim=999)\nbperm\n\n\n    Monte-Carlo simulation of Geary C\n\ndata:  hunan$GDPPC \nweights: rswm_q \nnumber of simulations + 1: 1000 \n\nstatistic = 0.69072, observed rank = 1, p-value = 0.001\nalternative hypothesis: greater\n\n\nQuestion: What statistical conclusion can you draw from the output above?\nAns: The p-value of 0.001 is less than the conventional significance level of 0.05. Therefore, you would reject the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation. The results suggest that the observed spatial pattern in the hunan$GDPPC variable, as measured by Geary’s C, is statistically significant and not likely due to random chance. The positive alternative hypothesis indicates that the expected spatial pattern is greater than the observed pattern, implying positive spatial autocorrelation.\n\n\n4.5.3 Visualising the Monte Carlo Geary’s C\nNext, we will plot a histogram to reveal the distribution of the simulated values by using the code chunk below.\n\nmean(bperm$res[1:999])\n\n[1] 1.004402\n\n\n\nvar(bperm$res[1:999])\n\n[1] 0.007436493\n\n\n\nsummary(bperm$res[1:999])\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n 0.7142  0.9502  1.0052  1.0044  1.0595  1.2722 \n\n\n\nhist(bperm$res, freq=TRUE, breaks=20, xlab=\"Simulated Geary c\")\nabline(v=1, col=\"red\") \n\n\n\n\nQuestion: What statistical observation can you draw from the output?\nAns:\n\nThe mean being close to the expected value (1.0) under the null hypothesis suggests that the simulation process is generating Geary’s C values consistent with spatial randomness.\nThe histogram shows that Geary’s C values approximates a normal distribution."

    "text": "5 Spatial Correlogram\nSpatial correlograms are great to examine patterns of spatial autocorrelation in your data or model residuals. They show how correlated are pairs of spatial observations when you increase the distance (lag) between them - they are plots of some index of autocorrelation (Moran’s I or Geary’s c) against distance.Although correlograms are not as fundamental as variograms (a keystone concept of geostatistics), they are very useful as an exploratory and descriptive tool. For this purpose they actually provide richer information than variograms.\n\n5.1 Compute Moran’s I correlogram\nIn the code chunk below, sp.correlogram() of spdep package is used to compute a 6-lag spatial correlogram of GDPPC.

    "text": "7 Creating a LISA Cluster Map\nThe LISA Cluster Map shows the significant locations color coded by type of spatial autocorrelation. The first step before we can generate the LISA cluster map is to plot the Moran scatterplot.\n\n7.1 Plotting Moran scatterplot\nThe Moran scatterplot is an illustration of the relationship between the values of the chosen attribute at each location and the average value of the same attribute at neighboring locations.\nThe code chunk below plots the Moran scatterplot of GDPPC 2012 by using moran.plot() of spdep.\n\nnci &lt;- moran.plot(hunan$GDPPC, rswm_q,\n                  labels=as.character(hunan$County), \n                  xlab=\"GDPPC 2012\", \n                  ylab=\"Spatially Lag GDPPC 2012\")\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the plot is split in 4 quadrants. The top right corner belongs to areas that have high GDPPC and are surrounded by other areas that have the average level of GDPPC. This are the high-high locations in the lesson slide.\n\n\n7.2 Plotting Moran scatterplot with standardised variable\nFirst we will use scale() to centers and scales the variable. Here centering is done by subtracting the mean (omitting NAs) the corresponding columns, and scaling is done by dividing the (centered) variable by their standard deviations.\n\nhunan$Z.GDPPC &lt;- scale(hunan$GDPPC) %&gt;% \n  as.vector \n\nThe as.vector() added to the end is to make sure that the data type we get out of this is a vector, that map neatly into out dataframe.\nNow, we are ready to plot the Moran scatterplot again by using the code chunk below.\n\nnci2 &lt;- moran.plot(hunan$Z.GDPPC, rswm_q,\n                   labels=as.character(hunan$County),\n                   xlab=\"z-GDPPC 2012\", \n                   ylab=\"Spatially Lag z-GDPPC 2012\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3 Preparing LISA map classes\nThe code chunks below show the steps to prepare a LISA cluster map.\n\nquadrant &lt;- vector(mode=\"numeric\",length=nrow(localMI))\n\nNext, derives the spatially lagged variable of interest (i.e. GDPPC) and centers the spatially lagged variable around its mean.\n\nhunan$lag_GDPPC &lt;- lag.listw(rswm_q, hunan$GDPPC)\nDV &lt;- hunan$lag_GDPPC - mean(hunan$lag_GDPPC)     \n\nThis is follow by centering the local Moran’s around the mean.\n\nLM_I &lt;- localMI[,1] - mean(localMI[,1])    \n\nNext, we will set a statistical significance level for the local Moran.\n\nsignif &lt;- 0.05       \n\nThese four command lines define the low-low (1), low-high (2), high-low (3) and high-high (4) categories.\n\nquadrant[DV &lt;0 & LM_I&gt;0] &lt;- 1\nquadrant[DV &gt;0 & LM_I&lt;0] &lt;- 2\nquadrant[DV &lt;0 & LM_I&lt;0] &lt;- 3  \nquadrant[DV &gt;0 & LM_I&gt;0] &lt;- 4      \n\nLastly, places non-significant Moran in the category 0.\n\nquadrant[localMI[,5]&gt;signif] &lt;- 0\n\nIn fact, we can combined all the steps into one single code chunk as shown below:\n\nquadrant &lt;- vector(mode=\"numeric\",length=nrow(localMI))\nhunan$lag_GDPPC &lt;- lag.listw(rswm_q, hunan$GDPPC)\nDV &lt;- hunan$lag_GDPPC - mean(hunan$lag_GDPPC)     \nLM_I &lt;- localMI[,1]   \nsignif &lt;- 0.05       \nquadrant[DV &lt;0 & LM_I&gt;0] &lt;- 1\nquadrant[DV &gt;0 & LM_I&lt;0] &lt;- 2\nquadrant[DV &lt;0 & LM_I&lt;0] &lt;- 3  \nquadrant[DV &gt;0 & LM_I&gt;0] &lt;- 4    \nquadrant[localMI[,5]&gt;signif] &lt;- 0\n\n\n\n7.4 Plotting LISA map\nNow, we can build the LISA map by using the code chunks below.\n\nhunan.localMI$quadrant &lt;- quadrant\ncolors &lt;- c(\"#ffffff\", \"#2c7bb6\", \"#abd9e9\", \"#fdae61\", \"#d7191c\")\nclusters &lt;- c(\"insignificant\", \"low-low\", \"low-high\", \"high-low\", \"high-high\")\n\ntm_shape(hunan.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"quadrant\", \n          style = \"cat\", \n          palette = colors[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1], \n          labels = clusters[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1],\n          popup.vars = c(\"\")) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,17)) +\n  tm_borders(alpha=0.5)\n\n\n\n\nFor effective interpretation, it is better to plot both the local Moran’s I values map and its corresponding p-values map next to each other.\nThe code chunk below will be used to create such visualisation.\n\ngdppc &lt;- qtm(hunan, \"GDPPC\")\n\nhunan.localMI$quadrant &lt;- quadrant\ncolors &lt;- c(\"#ffffff\", \"#2c7bb6\", \"#abd9e9\", \"#fdae61\", \"#d7191c\")\nclusters &lt;- c(\"insignificant\", \"low-low\", \"low-high\", \"high-low\", \"high-high\")\n\nLISAmap &lt;- tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"quadrant\", \n          style = \"cat\", \n          palette = colors[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1], \n          labels = clusters[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1],\n          popup.vars = c(\"\")) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,17)) +\n  tm_borders(alpha=0.5)\n\ntmap_arrange(gdppc, LISAmap, \n             asp=1, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\nWe can also include the local Moran’s I map and p-value map as shown below for easy comparison.\n\nQuestion: What statistical observations can you draw from the LISA map above?\nAns: The LISA map categorizes each observation into one of four quadrants: High-High, Insignificant, High-Low, and Low-High.\n\nHigh-High (HH): High values surrounded by high values.\nInsignificant : Low values surrounded by low values. (Mostly are insignificant)\nHigh-Low (HL): High values surrounded by low values.\nLow-High (LH): Low values surrounded by high values."

    "section": "8 Hot Spot and Cold Spot Area Analysis",
    "text": "8 Hot Spot and Cold Spot Area Analysis\nBeside detecting cluster and outliers, localised spatial statistics can be also used to detect hot spot and/or cold spot areas.\nThe term ‘hot spot’ has been used generically across disciplines to describe a region or value that is higher relative to its surroundings (Lepers et al 2005, Aben et al 2012, Isobe et al 2015).\n\n8.1 Getis and Ord’s G-Statistics\nAn alternative spatial statistics to detect spatial anomalies is the Getis and Ord’s G-statistics (Getis and Ord, 1972; Ord and Getis, 1995). It looks at neighbours within a defined proximity to identify where either high or low values clutser spatially. Here, statistically significant hot-spots are recognised as areas of high values where other areas within a neighbourhood range also share high values too.\nThe analysis consists of three steps:\n\nDeriving spatial weight matrix\nComputing Gi statistics\nMapping Gi statistics\n\n\n\n8.2 Deriving distance-based weight matrix\nFirst, we need to define a new set of neighbours. Whist the spatial autocorrelation considered units which shared borders, for Getis-Ord we are defining neighbours based on distance.\nThere are two type of distance-based proximity matrix, they are:\n\nfixed distance weight matrix; and\nadaptive distance weight matrix.\n\n\n8.2.1 Deriving the centroid\nWe will need points to associate with each polygon before we can make our connectivity graph. It will be a little more complicated than just running st_centroid() on the sf object: us.bound. We need the coordinates in a separate data frame for this to work. To do this we will use a mapping function. The mapping function applies a given function to each element of a vector and returns a vector of the same length. Our input vector will be the geometry column of us.bound. Our function will be st_centroid(). We will be using map_dbl variation of map from the purrr package. For more documentation, check out map documentation\nTo get our longitude values we map the st_centroid() function over the geometry column of us.bound and access the longitude value through double bracket notation [[]] and 1. This allows us to get only the longitude, which is the first value in each centroid.\n\nlongitude &lt;- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[1]])\n\nWe do the same for latitude with one key difference. We access the second value per each centroid with [[2]].\n\nlatitude &lt;- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[2]])\n\nNow that we have latitude and longitude, we use cbind to put longitude and latitude into the same object.\n\ncoords &lt;- cbind(longitude, latitude)\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Determine the cut-off distance\nFirstly, we need to determine the upper limit for distance band by using the steps below:\n\nReturn a matrix with the indices of points belonging to the set of the k nearest neighbours of each other by using knearneigh() of spdep.\nConvert the knn object returned by knearneigh() into a neighbours list of class nb with a list of integer vectors containing neighbour region number ids by using knn2nb().\nReturn the length of neighbour relationship edges by using nbdists() of spdep. The function returns in the units of the coordinates if the coordinates are projected, in km otherwise.\nRemove the list structure of the returned object by using unlist().\n\n\n#coords &lt;- coordinates(hunan)\nk1 &lt;- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords))\nk1dists &lt;- unlist(nbdists(k1, coords, longlat = TRUE))\nsummary(k1dists)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n  24.79   32.57   38.01   39.07   44.52   61.79 \n\n\nThe summary report shows that the largest first nearest neighbour distance is 61.79 km, so using this as the upper threshold gives certainty that all units will have at least one neighbour.\n\n\n8.2.3 Computing fixed distance weight matrix\nNow, we will compute the distance weight matrix by using dnearneigh() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nwm_d62 &lt;- dnearneigh(coords, 0, 62, longlat = TRUE)\nwm_d62\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 324 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 4.183884 \nAverage number of links: 3.681818 \n\n\nNext, nb2listw() is used to convert the nb object into spatial weights object.\n\nwm62_lw &lt;- nb2listw(wm_d62, style = 'B')\nsummary(wm62_lw)\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 324 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 4.183884 \nAverage number of links: 3.681818 \nLink number distribution:\n\n 1  2  3  4  5  6 \n 6 15 14 26 20  7 \n6 least connected regions:\n6 15 30 32 56 65 with 1 link\n7 most connected regions:\n21 28 35 45 50 52 82 with 6 links\n\nWeights style: B \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn  S0  S1   S2\nB 88 7744 324 648 5440\n\n\nThe output spatial weights object is called wm62_lw.\n\n\n\n8.3 Computing adaptive distance weight matrix\nOne of the characteristics of fixed distance weight matrix is that more densely settled areas (usually the urban areas) tend to have more neighbours and the less densely settled areas (usually the rural counties) tend to have lesser neighbours. Having many neighbours smoothes the neighbour relationship across more neighbours.\nIt is possible to control the numbers of neighbours directly using k-nearest neighbours, either accepting asymmetric neighbours or imposing symmetry as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nknn &lt;- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k=8))\nknn\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 704 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 9.090909 \nAverage number of links: 8 \nNon-symmetric neighbours list\n\n\nNext, nb2listw() is used to convert the nb object into spatial weights object.\n\nknn_lw &lt;- nb2listw(knn, style = 'B')\nsummary(knn_lw)\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 704 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 9.090909 \nAverage number of links: 8 \nNon-symmetric neighbours list\nLink number distribution:\n\n 8 \n88 \n88 least connected regions:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 with 8 links\n88 most connected regions:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 with 8 links\n\nWeights style: B \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn  S0   S1    S2\nB 88 7744 704 1300 23014"

localG() is a vector of G or Gstar values, with attributes “gstari” set to TRUE or FALSE, “call” set to the function call, and class “localG”.\nThe Gi statistics is represented as a Z-score. Greater values represent a greater intensity of clustering and the direction (positive or negative) indicates high or low clusters.\nNext, we will join the Gi values to their corresponding hunan sf data frame by using the code chunk below.\n\nhunan.gi &lt;- cbind(hunan, as.matrix(gi.fixed)) %&gt;%\n  rename(gstat_fixed = as.matrix.gi.fixed.)\n\nIn fact, the code chunk above performs three tasks. First, it convert the output vector (i.e. gi.fixed) into r matrix object by using as.matrix(). Next, cbind() is used to join hunan@data and gi.fixed matrix to produce a new SpatialPolygonDataFrame called hunan.gi. Lastly, the field name of the gi values is renamed to gstat_fixed by using rename().\n\n\n9.2 Mapping Gi values with fixed distance weights\nThe code chunk below shows the functions used to map the Gi values derived using fixed distance weight matrix.\n\ngdppc &lt;- qtm(hunan, \"GDPPC\")\n\nGimap &lt;-tm_shape(hunan.gi) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"gstat_fixed\", \n          style = \"pretty\",\n          palette=\"-RdBu\",\n          title = \"local Gi\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\ntmap_arrange(gdppc, Gimap, asp=1, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: What statistical observation can you draw from the Gi map above?\nAns: High Gi values may represent hotspots where values are significantly higher than their neighbors, while low Gi values may represent coldspots with significantly lower values.\n\n\n9.3 Gi statistics using adaptive distance\nThe code chunk below are used to compute the Gi values for GDPPC2012 by using an adaptive distance weight matrix (i.e knb_lw).\n\nfips &lt;- order(hunan$County)\ngi.adaptive &lt;- localG(hunan$GDPPC, knn_lw)\nhunan.gi &lt;- cbind(hunan, as.matrix(gi.adaptive)) %&gt;%\n  rename(gstat_adaptive = as.matrix.gi.adaptive.)\n\n\n\n9.4 Mapping Gi values with adaptive distance weights\nIt is time for us to visualise the locations of hot spot and cold spot areas. The choropleth mapping functions of tmap package will be used to map the Gi values.\nThe code chunk below shows the functions used to map the Gi values derived using fixed distance weight matrix.\n\ngdppc&lt;- qtm(hunan, \"GDPPC\")\n\nGimap &lt;- tm_shape(hunan.gi) + \n  tm_fill(col = \"gstat_adaptive\", \n          style = \"pretty\", \n          palette=\"-RdBu\", \n          title = \"local Gi\") + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\ntmap_arrange(gdppc, \n             Gimap, \n             asp=1, \n             ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: What statistical observation can you draw from the Gi map above?\nAns: When using adaptive distance weights in spatial analysis, the weights assigned to neighboring observations are not fixed but are adjusted based on the local characteristics of the data. This adaptation is often done to account for spatial heterogeneity, allowing the weights to vary across different regions."

This means that more condominium units were transacted at relative lower prices.\nStatistically, the skewed dsitribution can be normalised by using log transformation. The code chunk below is used to derive a new variable called LOG_SELLING_PRICE by using a log transformation on the variable SELLING_PRICE. It is performed using mutate() of dplyr package.\n\ncondo_resale.sf &lt;- condo_resale.sf %&gt;%\n  mutate(`LOG_SELLING_PRICE` = log(SELLING_PRICE))\n\nNow, you can plot the LOG_SELLING_PRICE using the code chunk below.\n\nggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x=`LOG_SELLING_PRICE`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the distribution is relatively less skewed after the transformation.\n\n\n7.2 Multiple Histogram Plots distribution of variables\nIn this section, you will learn how to draw a small multiple histograms (also known as trellis plot) by using ggarrange() of ggpubr package.\nThe code chunk below is used to create 12 histograms.

    "text": "8 Hedonic Pricing Modelling in R\nIn this section, you will learn how to building hedonic pricing models for condominium resale units using lm() of R base.\n\n8.1 Simple Linear Regression Method\nFirst, we will build a simple linear regression model by using SELLING_PRICE as the dependent variable and AREA_SQM as the independent variable.\n\ncondo.slr &lt;- lm(formula=SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM, data = condo_resale.sf)\n\nlm() returns an object of class “lm” or for multiple responses of class c(“mlm”, “lm”).\nThe functions summary() and anova() can be used to obtain and print a summary and analysis of variance table of the results. The generic accessor functions coefficients, effects, fitted.values and residuals extract various useful features of the value returned by lm.\n\nsummary(condo.slr)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM, data = condo_resale.sf)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-3695815  -391764   -87517   258900 13503875 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

This will allow us to infer that simple linear regression model above is a good estimator of SELLING_PRICE.\nThe Coefficients: section of the report reveals that the p-values of both the estimates of the Intercept and ARA_SQM are smaller than 0.001. In view of this, the null hypothesis of the B0 and B1 are equal to 0 will be rejected. As a results, we will be able to infer that the B0 and B1 are good parameter estimates.\nTo visualise the best fit curve on a scatterplot, we can incorporate lm() as a method function in ggplot’s geometry as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nggplot(data=condo_resale.sf,  \n       aes(x=`AREA_SQM`, y=`SELLING_PRICE`)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm)\n\n\n\n\nFigure above reveals that there are a few statistical outliers with relatively high selling prices.\n\n\n8.2 Multiple Linear Regression Method\n\n8.2.1 Visualising the relationships of the independent variables\nBefore building a multiple regression model, it is important to ensure that the indepdent variables used are not highly correlated to each other. If these highly correlated independent variables are used in building a regression model by mistake, the quality of the model will be compromised. This phenomenon is known as multicollinearity in statistics.\nCorrelation matrix is commonly used to visualise the relationships between the independent variables. Beside the pairs() of R, there are many packages support the display of a correlation matrix. In this section, the corrplot package will be used.\nThe code chunk below is used to plot a scatterplot matrix of the relationship between the independent variables in condo_resale data.frame.\n\ncorrplot(cor(condo_resale[, 5:23]), diag = FALSE, order = \"AOE\",\n         tl.pos = \"td\", tl.cex = 0.5, method = \"number\", type = \"upper\")\n\n\n\n\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and patter in the matrix. There are four methods in corrplot (parameter order), named “AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. In the code chunk above, AOE order is used. It orders the variables by using the angular order of the eigenvectors method suggested by Michael Friendly.\nFrom the scatterplot matrix, it is clear that Freehold is highly correlated to LEASE_99YEAR.

It is called olsrr. It provides a collection of very useful methods for building better multiple linear regression models:\n\ncomprehensive regression output\nresidual diagnostics\nmeasures of influence\nheteroskedasticity tests\ncollinearity diagnostics\nmodel fit assessment\nvariable contribution assessment\nvariable selection procedures\n\nIn the code chunk below, the ols_vif_tol() of olsrr package is used to test if there are sign of multicollinearity.\n\nols_vif_tol(condo.mlr1)\n\n              Variables Tolerance      VIF\n1              AREA_SQM 0.8728554 1.145665\n2                   AGE 0.7071275 1.414172\n3              PROX_CBD 0.6356147 1.573280\n4        PROX_CHILDCARE 0.3066019 3.261559\n5      PROX_ELDERLYCARE 0.6598479 1.515501\n6  PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA 0.7510311 1.331503\n7              PROX_MRT 0.5236090 1.909822\n8             PROX_PARK 0.8279261 1.207837\n9      PROX_PRIMARY_SCH 0.4524628 2.210126\n10   PROX_SHOPPING_MALL 0.6738795 1.483945\n11        PROX_BUS_STOP 0.3514118 2.845664\n12          NO_Of_UNITS 0.6901036 1.449058\n13      FAMILY_FRIENDLY 0.7244157 1.380423\n14             FREEHOLD 0.6931163 1.442759\n\n\nSince the VIF of the independent variables are less than 10. We can safely conclude that there are no sign of multicollinearity among the independent variables.\n\n\n8.5.2 Test for Non-Linearity\nIn multiple linear regression, it is important for us to test the assumption that linearity and additivity of the relationship between dependent and independent variables.\nIn the code chunk below, the ols_plot_resid_fit() of olsrr package is used to perform linearity assumption test.\n\nols_plot_resid_fit(condo.mlr1)\n\n\n\n\nThe figure above reveals that most of the data poitns are scattered around the 0 line, hence we can safely conclude that the relationships between the dependent variable and independent variables are linear.\n\n\n8.5.3 Test for Normality Assumption\nLastly, the code chunk below uses ols_plot_resid_hist() of olsrr package to perform normality assumption test.\n\nols_plot_resid_hist(condo.mlr1)\n\n\n\n\nThe figure reveals that the residual of the multiple linear regression model (i.e. condo.mlr1) is resemble normal distribution.\nIf you prefer formal statistical test methods, the ols_test_normality() of olsrr package can be used as shown in the code chun below.\n\nols_test_normality(condo.mlr1)\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n       Test             Statistic       pvalue  \n-----------------------------------------------\nShapiro-Wilk              0.6856         0.0000 \nKolmogorov-Smirnov        0.1366         0.0000 \nCramer-von Mises         121.0768        0.0000 \nAnderson-Darling         67.9551         0.0000 \n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe summary table above reveals that the p-values of the four tests are way smaller than the alpha value of 0.05. Hence we will reject the null hypothesis and infer that there is statistical evidence that the residual are not normally distributed.\n\n\n8.5.4 Testing for Spatial Autocorrelation\nThe hedonic model we try to build are using geographically referenced attributes, hence it is also important for us to visual the residual of the hedonic pricing model.\nIn order to perform spatial autocorrelation

    "text": "9 Building Hedonic Pricing Models using GWmodel\nIn this section, you are going to learn how to modelling hedonic pricing using both the fixed and adaptive bandwidth schemes\n\n9.1 Building Fixed Bandwidth GWR Model\n\n9.1.1 Computing fixed bandwith\nIn the code chunk below bw.gwr() of GWModel package is used to determine the optimal fixed bandwidth to use in the model. Notice that the argument adaptive is set to FALSE indicates that we are interested to compute the fixed bandwidth.\nThere are two possible approaches can be uused to determine the stopping rule, they are: CV cross-validation approach and AIC corrected (AICc) approach. We define the stopping rule using approach argeement.\n\n#bw.fixed &lt;- bw.gwr(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + PROX_CBD + \n#                     PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE  + PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + \n#                     PROX_MRT   + PROX_PARK + PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + \n#                     PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + NO_Of_UNITS + \n#                     FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n#                   data=condo_resale.sp, \n#                   approach=\"CV\", \n#                   kernel=\"gaussian\", \n#                   adaptive=FALSE, \n#                   longlat=FALSE)\n\nThe result shows that the recommended bandwidth is 971.3405 metres. (Quiz: Do you know why it is in metre?)\n** Cannot install GWmodel, the github repository cannot be found Error 404.\n\n\n9.1.2 GWModel method - fixed bandwith\nNow we can use the code chunk below to calibrate the gwr model using fixed bandwidth and gaussian kernel.\n\n#gwr.fixed &lt;- gwr.basic(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + PROX_CBD + \n#                         PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE  + PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + \n#                         PROX_MRT   + PROX_PARK + PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + \n#                         PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + NO_Of_UNITS + \n#                         FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n#                       data=condo_resale.sp, \n#                       bw=bw.fixed, \n#                       kernel = 'gaussian', \n#                       longlat = FALSE)\n\nThe output is saved in a list of class “gwrm”. The code below can be used to display the model output.\n\n#gwr.fixed\n\nThe report shows that the AICc of the gwr is 42263.61 which is significantly smaller than the globel multiple linear regression model of 42967.1.\n\n\n\n9.2 Building Adaptive Bandwidth GWR Model\nIn this section, we will calibrate the gwr-based hedonic pricing model by using adaptive bandwidth approach.\n\n9.2.1 Computing the adaptive bandwidth\nSimilar to the earlier section, we will first use bw.gwr() to determine the recommended data point to use.\nThe code chunk used look very similar to the one used to compute the fixed bandwidth except the adaptive argument has changed to TRUE.\n\n#bw.adaptive &lt;- bw.gwr(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE  + \n#                        PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE    + \n#                        PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_MRT + PROX_PARK + \n#                        PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL   + PROX_BUS_STOP + \n#                        NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n#                      data=condo_resale.sp, \n#                      approach=\"CV\", \n#                      kernel=\"gaussian\", \n#                      adaptive=TRUE, \n#                      longlat=FALSE)\n\nThe result shows that the 30 is the recommended data points to be used.\n\n\n9.2.2 Constructing the adaptive bandwidth gwr model\nNow, we can go ahead to calibrate the gwr-based hedonic pricing model by using adaptive bandwidth and gaussian kernel as shown in the code chunk below.\n\n#gwr.adaptive &lt;- gwr.basic(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + \n#                            PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE + \n#                            PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_MRT + PROX_PARK + \n#                            PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + \n#                            NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n#                          data=condo_resale.sp, bw=bw.adaptive, \n#                          kernel = 'gaussian', \n#                          adaptive=TRUE, \n#                          longlat = FALSE)\n\nThe code below can be used to display the model output.\n\n#gwr.adaptive\n\nThe report shows that the AICc the adaptive distance gwr is 41982.22 which is even smaller than the AICc of the fixed distance gwr of 42263.61.\n\n\n\n9.3 Visualising GWR Output\nIn addition to regression residuals, the output feature class table includes fields for observed and predicted y values, condition number (cond), Local R2, residuals, and explanatory variable coefficients and standard errors:\n\nCondition Number: this diagnostic evaluates local collinearity. In the presence of strong local collinearity, results become unstable. Results associated with condition numbers larger than 30, may be unreliable.\nLocal R2: these values range between 0.0 and 1.0 and indicate how well the local regression model fits observed y values. Very low values indicate the local model is performing poorly. Mapping the Local R2 values to see where GWR predicts well and where it predicts poorly may provide clues about important variables that may be missing from the regression model.\nPredicted: these are the estimated (or fitted) y values 3. computed by GWR.\nResiduals: to obtain the residual values, the fitted y values are subtracted from the observed y values. Standardized residuals have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. A cold-to-hot rendered map of standardized residuals can be produce by using these values.\nCoefficient Standard Error: these values measure the reliability of each coefficient estimate. Confidence in those estimates are higher when standard errors are small in relation to the actual coefficient values. Large standard errors may indicate problems with local collinearity.\n\nThey are all stored in a SpatialPointsDataFrame or SpatialPolygonsDataFrame object integrated with fit.points, GWR coefficient estimates, y value, predicted values, coefficient standard errors and t-values in its “data” slot in an object called SDF of the output list.\n\n\n9.4 Converting SDF into sf data.frame\nTo visualise the fields in SDF, we need to first covert it into sf data.frame by using the code chunk below.\n\n#condo_resale.sf.adaptive &lt;- st_as_sf(gwr.adaptive$SDF) %&gt;%\n#  st_transform(crs=3414)\n\n\n#condo_resale.sf.adaptive.svy21 &lt;- st_transform(condo_resale.sf.adaptive, 3414)\n#condo_resale.sf.adaptive.svy21  \n\n\n#gwr.adaptive.output &lt;- as.data.frame(gwr.adaptive$SDF)\n#condo_resale.sf.adaptive &lt;- cbind(condo_resale.res.sf, as.matrix(gwr.adaptive.output))\n\nNext, glimpse() is used to display the content of condo_resale.sf.adaptive sf data frame.\n\n#glimpse(condo_resale.sf.adaptive)\n\n\n#summary(gwr.adaptive$SDF$yhat)\n\n\n\n9.5 Visualising local R2\nThe code chunks below is used to create an interactive point symbol map.\n\n#tmap_mode(\"view\")\n#tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n#  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\n#tm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n#  tm_dots(col = \"Local_R2\",\n#          border.col = \"gray60\",\n#          border.lwd = 1) +\n#  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\n\n#tmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\n\n9.6 Visualising coefficient estimates\nThe code chunks below is used to create an interactive point symbol map.\n\n#tmap_mode(\"view\")\n#AREA_SQM_SE &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n#  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\n#tm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n#  tm_dots(col = \"AREA_SQM_SE\",\n#          border.col = \"gray60\",\n#          border.lwd = 1) +\n#  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\n#AREA_SQM_TV &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n#  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\n#tm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n#  tm_dots(col = \"AREA_SQM_TV\",\n#          border.col = \"gray60\",\n#          border.lwd = 1) +\n#  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\n#tmap_arrange(AREA_SQM_SE, AREA_SQM_TV, \n#             asp=1, ncol=2,\n#             sync = TRUE)\n\n\n#tmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\n9.6.1 By URA Planning Region\n\n#tm_shape(mpsz_svy21[mpsz_svy21$REGION_N==\"CENTRAL REGION\", ])+\n#  tm_polygons()+\n#tm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) + \n#  tm_bubbles(col = \"Local_R2\",\n#           size = 0.15,\n#           border.col = \"gray60\",\n#           border.lwd = 1)"

Our task in this study, hence, is to apply appropriate spatial statistical methods to discover if development are even distributed geographically. If the answer is No. Then, our next question will be “is there sign of spatial clustering?”. And, if the answer for this question is yes, then our next question will be “where are these clusters?”\nIn this case study, we are interested to examine the spatial pattern of a selected development indicator (i.e. GDP per capita) of Hunan Provice, People Republic of China.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunan)\n\n\n2.2 The Study Area and Data\nTwo data sets will be used in this hands-on exercise, they are:\n\nHunan province administrative boundary layer at county level. This is a geospatial data set in ESRI shapefile format.\nHunan_2012.csv: This csv file contains selected Hunan’s local development indicators in 2012.\n\n\n\n2.3 Setting the Analytical Tools\nBefore we get started, we need to ensure that spdep, sf, tmap and tidyverse packages of R are currently installed in your R.\n\nsf is use for importing and handling geospatial data in R,\ntidyverse is mainly use for wrangling attribute data in R,\nspdep will be used to compute spatial weights, global and local spatial autocorrelation statistics, and\ntmap will be used to prepare cartographic quality chropleth map.\n\nThe code chunk below is used to perform the following tasks:\n\ncreating a package list containing the necessary R packages,\nchecking if the R packages in the package list have been installed in R,\n\nif they have yet to be installed, RStudio will installed the missing packages,\n\nlaunching the packages into R environment.\n\n\npacman::p_load(sf, spdep, tmap, tidyverse)"

    "section": "4 Global Spatial Autocorrelation",
    "text": "4 Global Spatial Autocorrelation\nIn this section, you will learn how to compute global spatial autocorrelation statistics and to perform spatial complete randomness test for global spatial autocorrelation.\n\n4.1 Computing Contiguity Spatial Weights\nBefore we can compute the global spatial autocorrelation statistics, we need to construct a spatial weights of the study area. The spatial weights is used to define the neighbourhood relationships between the geographical units (i.e. county) in the study area.\nIn the code chunk below, poly2nb() of spdep package is used to compute contiguity weight matrices for the study area. This function builds a neighbours list based on regions with contiguous boundaries. If you look at the documentation you will see that you can pass a “queen” argument that takes TRUE or FALSE as options. If you do not specify this argument the default is set to TRUE, that is, if you don’t specify queen = FALSE this function will return a list of first order neighbours using the Queen criteria.\nMore specifically, the code chunk below is used to compute Queen contiguity weight matrix.\n\nwm_q &lt;- poly2nb(hunan, \n                queen=TRUE)\nsummary(wm_q)\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \nLink number distribution:\n\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 11 \n 2  2 12 16 24 14 11  4  2  1 \n2 least connected regions:\n30 65 with 1 link\n1 most connected region:\n85 with 11 links\n\n\nThe summary report above shows that there are 88 area units in Hunan. The most connected area unit has 11 neighbours. There are two area units with only one neighbours.\n\n\n4.2 Row-standardised weights matrix\nNext, we need to assign weights to each neighboring polygon. In our case, each neighboring polygon will be assigned equal weight (style=“W”). This is accomplished by assigning the fraction 1/(#ofneighbors) to each neighboring county then summing the weighted income values. While this is the most intuitive way to summaries the neighbors’ values it has one drawback in that polygons along the edges of the study area will base their lagged values on fewer polygons thus potentially over- or under-estimating the true nature of the spatial autocorrelation in the data. For this example, we’ll stick with the style=“W” option for simplicity’s sake but note that other more robust options are available, notably style=“B”.\n\nrswm_q &lt;- nb2listw(wm_q, \n                   style=\"W\", \n                   zero.policy = TRUE)\nrswm_q\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \n\nWeights style: W \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn S0       S1       S2\nW 88 7744 88 37.86334 365.9147\n\n\nThe input of nb2listw() must be an object of class nb. The syntax of the function has two major arguments, namely style and zero.poly.\n\nstyle can take values “W”, “B”, “C”, “U”, “minmax” and “S”. B is the basic binary coding, W is row standardised (sums over all links to n), C is globally standardised (sums over all links to n), U is equal to C divided by the number of neighbours (sums over all links to unity), while S is the variance-stabilizing coding scheme proposed by Tiefelsdorf et al. 1999, p. 167-168 (sums over all links to n).\nIf zero policy is set to TRUE, weights vectors of zero length are inserted for regions without neighbour in the neighbours list. These will in turn generate lag values of zero, equivalent to the sum of products of the zero row t(rep(0, length=length(neighbours))) %*% x, for arbitrary numerical vector x of length length(neighbours). The spatially lagged value of x for the zero-neighbour region will then be zero, which may (or may not) be a sensible choice.\n\n\n\n4.3 Global Spatial Autocorrelation: Moran’s I\nIn this section, you will learn how to perform Moran’s I statistics testing by using moran.test() of spdep.\n\n\n4.4 Maron’s I test\nThe code chunk below performs Moran’s I statistical testing using moran.test() of spdep.\n\nmoran.test(hunan$GDPPC, \n           listw=rswm_q, \n           zero.policy = TRUE, \n           na.action=na.omit)\n\n\n    Moran I test under randomisation\n\ndata:  hunan$GDPPC  \nweights: rswm_q    \n\nMoran I statistic standard deviate = 4.7351, p-value = 1.095e-06\nalternative hypothesis: greater\nsample estimates:\nMoran I statistic       Expectation          Variance \n      0.300749970      -0.011494253       0.004348351 \n\n\nQuestion: What statistical conclusion can you draw from the output above?\nAns:\nH0: The GDPPC values are randomly distributed across Hunan following a completely random process\nThe small p-value and the positive Moran’s I statistic suggest that there is significant positive spatial autocorrelation in the hunan$GDPPC variable based on the provided spatial weights matrix. In other words, regions with similar GDPPC values tend to be spatially clustered in this dataset. The observed spatial pattern is unlikely to occur by random chance alone.\nNote: It implements a two-sided test as opposed to the one-sided test adopted in the above example (i.e. alternative = \"greater\"). A two-sided p-value is nothing more than twice the one-sided p-value. However, there is no important distinction in any of the documentation provided. Fortunately, the GDPPC value is so strongly clustered that both a one-sided and two-sided test produce the same outcome (a p-value close to 0).\n\n4.4.1 Computing Monte Carlo Moran’s I\nThe code chunk below performs permutation test for Moran’s I statistic by using moran.mc() of spdep. A total of 1000 simulation will be performed.\n\nset.seed(1234)\nbperm= moran.mc(hunan$GDPPC, \n                listw=rswm_q, \n                nsim=999, \n                zero.policy = TRUE, \n                na.action=na.omit)\nbperm\n\n\n    Monte-Carlo simulation of Moran I\n\ndata:  hunan$GDPPC \nweights: rswm_q  \nnumber of simulations + 1: 1000 \n\nstatistic = 0.30075, observed rank = 1000, p-value = 0.001\nalternative hypothesis: greater\n\n\nQuestion: What statistical conclustion can you draw fro mthe output above?\nAns: The p-value of 0.001 is less than the conventional significance level of 0.05. Therefore, you would reject the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation. The results suggest that the observed spatial pattern in the hunan$GDPPC variable, as measured by Moran’s I, is statistically significant and not likely due to random chance. The positive Moran’s I value indicates positive spatial autocorrelation, meaning similar values are spatially clustered in the dataset.\n\n\n4.4.2 Visualising Monte Carlo Moran’s I\nIt is always a good practice for us the examine the simulated Moran’s I test statistics in greater detail. This can be achieved by plotting the distribution of the statistical values as a histogram by using the code chunk below.\nIn the code chunk below hist() and abline() of R Graphics are used.\n\nmean(bperm$res[1:999])\n\n[1] -0.01504572\n\n\n\nvar(bperm$res[1:999])\n\n[1] 0.004371574\n\n\n\nsummary(bperm$res[1:999])\n\n    Min.  1st Qu.

The distribution of simulated Moran’s I values suggests that the observed Moran’s I from the original data is statistically significant and unlikely to be due to random chance. The positive skewness implies that positive spatial autocorrelation is less common under the null hypothesis than would be expected by chance.\n\n\n\nChallenge: Instead of using Base Graph to plot the values, plot the values by using ggplot2 package.\n\n\n# Create a data frame for the simulated Moran's I values\nsim_data &lt;- data.frame(Moran_I = bperm$res)\n\n# Plot the histogram using ggplot2\nggplot(sim_data, aes(x = Moran_I)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.02, fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Simulated Moran's I\",\n       x = \"Simulated Moran's I\",\n       y = \"Frequency\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Global Spatial Autocorrelation: Geary’s\nIn this section, you will learn how to perform Geary’s c statistics testing by using appropriate functions of spdep package.\n\n4.5.1 Geary’s C test\nThe code chunk below performs Geary’s C test for spatial autocorrelation by using geary.test() of spdep.\n\ngeary.test(hunan$GDPPC, listw=rswm_q)\n\n\n    Geary C test under randomisation\n\ndata:  hunan$GDPPC \nweights: rswm_q \n\nGeary C statistic standard deviate = 3.6108, p-value = 0.0001526\nalternative hypothesis: Expectation greater than statistic\nsample estimates:\nGeary C statistic       Expectation          Variance \n        0.6907223         1.0000000         0.0073364 \n\n\nQuestion: What statistical conclusion can you draw from the output above?\nAns: The small p-value of 0.0001526 suggests that the observed spatial pattern in the hunan$GDPPC variable, as measured by Geary’s C, is statistically significant. The observed Geary’s C statistic is significantly lower than what would be expected by random chance alone. This implies positive spatial autocorrelation, meaning similar values are clustered together in space. The conclusion is consistent with the alternative hypothesis that the expected spatial pattern is greater than the observed pattern.\n\n\n4.5.2 Computing Monte Carlo Geary’s C\nThe code chunk below performs permutation test for Geary’s C statistic by using geary.mc() of spdep.\n\nset.seed(1234)\nbperm=geary.mc(hunan$GDPPC, \n               listw=rswm_q, \n               nsim=999)\nbperm\n\n\n    Monte-Carlo simulation of Geary C\n\ndata:  hunan$GDPPC \nweights: rswm_q \nnumber of simulations + 1: 1000 \n\nstatistic = 0.69072, observed rank = 1, p-value = 0.001\nalternative hypothesis: greater\n\n\nQuestion: What statistical conclusion can you draw from the output above?\nAns: The p-value of 0.001 is less than the conventional significance level of 0.05. Therefore, you would reject the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation. The results suggest that the observed spatial pattern in the hunan$GDPPC variable, as measured by Geary’s C, is statistically significant and not likely due to random chance. The positive alternative hypothesis indicates that the expected spatial pattern is greater than the observed pattern, implying positive spatial autocorrelation.\n\n\n4.5.3 Visualising the Monte Carlo Geary’s C\nNext, we will plot a histogram to reveal the distribution of the simulated values by using the code chunk below.\n\nmean(bperm$res[1:999])\n\n[1] 1.004402\n\n\n\nvar(bperm$res[1:999])\n\n[1] 0.007436493\n\n\n\nsummary(bperm$res[1:999])\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

The explanatory variables are origin population by different age cohort, destination population by different age cohort (i.e. ORIGIN_AGE25_64) and distance between origin and destination in km (i.e. dist).\nThe general formula of Unconstrained Spatial Interaction Model\nThe code chunk undefinedsed to calibrate to model is shown below:\n\nuncSIM &lt;- glm(formula = TRIPS ~ \n                log(ORIGIN_AGE25_64) + \n                log(DESTIN_AGE25_64) +\n                log(dist),\n              family = poisson(link = \"log\"),\n              data = SIM_data,\n              na.action = na.exclude)\nuncSIM\n\n\nCall:  glm(formula = TRIPS ~ log(ORIGIN_AGE25_64) + log(DESTIN_AGE25_64) + \n    log(dist), family = poisson(link = \"log\"), data = SIM_data, \n    na.action = na.exclude)\n\nCoefficients:\n         (Intercept)  log(ORIGIN_AGE25_64)  log(DESTIN_AGE25_64)  \n            17.00287               0.21001               0.01289  \n           log(dist)  \n            -1.51785  \n\nDegrees of Freedom: 14273 Total (i.e. Null);  14270 Residual\nNull Deviance:      36120000 \nResidual Deviance: 19960000     AIC: 20040000\n\n\n\n\n8.5 R-squared function\nIn order to measure how much variation of the trips can be accounted by the model we will write a function to calculate R-Squared value as shown below.\n\nCalcRSquared &lt;- function(observed,estimated){\n  r &lt;- cor(observed,estimated)\n  R2 &lt;- r^2\n  R2\n}\n\nNext, we will compute the R-squared of the unconstrained SIM by using the code chunk below.\n\nCalcRSquared(uncSIM$data$TRIPS, uncSIM$fitted.values)\n\n[1] 0.1694734\n\n\n\nr2_mcfadden(uncSIM)\n\n# R2 for Generalized Linear Regression\n       R2: 0.446\n  adj.

In this sub-section, you will learn how to use compare_performance() of performance package\nFirst of all, let us create a list called model_list by using the code chun below.\n\nmodel_list &lt;- list(unconstrained=uncSIM,\n                   originConstrained=orcSIM,\n                   destinationConstrained=decSIM,\n                   doublyConstrained=dbcSIM)\n\nNext, we will compute the RMSE of all the models in model_list file by using the code chunk below.\n\ncompare_performance(model_list,\n                    metrics = \"RMSE\")\n\n# Comparison of Model Performance Indices\n\nName                   | Model |     RMSE\n-----------------------------------------\nunconstrained          |   glm | 2429.978\noriginConstrained      |   glm | 2057.579\ndestinationConstrained |   glm | 1891.724\ndoublyConstrained      |   glm | 1487.111\n\n\nThe print above reveals that doubly constrained SIM is the best model among all the four SIMs because it has the smallest RMSE value of 1487.111.\n\n\n8.10 Visualising fitted\nIn this section, you will learn how to visualise the observed values and the fitted values.\nFirstly we will extract the fitted values from each model by using the code chunk below.\n\ndf &lt;- as.data.frame(uncSIM$fitted.values) %&gt;%\n  round(digits = 0)\n\nNext, we will join the values to SIM_data data frame.\n\nSIM_data &lt;- SIM_data %&gt;%\n  cbind(df) %&gt;%\n  rename(uncTRIPS = \"uncSIM$fitted.values\")\n\nRepeat the same step by for Origin Constrained SIM (i.e. orcSIM)\n\ndf &lt;- as.data.frame(orcSIM$fitted.values) %&gt;%\n  round(digits = 0)\n\n\nSIM_data &lt;- SIM_data %&gt;%\n  cbind(df) %&gt;%\n  rename(orcTRIPS = \"orcSIM$fitted.values\")\n\nRepeat the same step by for Destination Constrained SIM (i.e. decSIM)\n\ndf &lt;- as.data.frame(decSIM$fitted.values) %&gt;%\n  round(digits = 0)\n\n\nSIM_data &lt;- SIM_data %&gt;%\n  cbind(df) %&gt;%\n  rename(decTRIPS = \"decSIM$fitted.values\")\n\nRepeat the same step by for Doubly Constrained SIM (i.e. dbcSIM)\n\ndf &lt;- as.data.frame(dbcSIM$fitted.values) %&gt;%\n  round(digits = 0)\n\n\nSIM_data &lt;- SIM_data %&gt;%\n  cbind(df) %&gt;%\n  rename(dbcTRIPS = \"dbcSIM$fitted.values\")\n\n\nunc_p &lt;- ggplot(data = SIM_data,\n                aes(x = uncTRIPS,\n                    y = TRIPS)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm)\n\norc_p &lt;- ggplot(data = SIM_data,\n                aes(x = orcTRIPS,\n                    y = TRIPS)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm)\n\ndec_p &lt;- ggplot(data = SIM_data,\n                aes(x = decTRIPS,\n                    y = TRIPS)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm)\n\ndbc_p &lt;- ggplot(data = SIM_data,\n                aes(x = dbcTRIPS,\n                    y = TRIPS)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm)\n\nggarrange(unc_p, orc_p, dec_p, dbc_p,\n          ncol = 2,\n          nrow = 2)"

In this take-home exercise, I will focus on passenger trips generated by origin bus stop, I will remove the rows with bus stops solely serve as destinations which are indicated by NA values on the corresponding “Total_Trips” using the filter() from dplyr package.\n\n\nShow the code\ntotal_trips_per_busstop_wdmp &lt;- left_join(busstop3414, odbus_weekday_6_9, by = c(\"BUS_STOP_N\" = \"ORIGIN_PT_CODE\")) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(TRIPS))\n\n\n\n\n8.2 Spatial Join with Hexagonal Honeycomb Grid and Calculating Total Trips in a Hexagonal Grid\nThe code chunk below will be used to join the total_trips_per_busstop and honeycomb grid spatially using st_join() from sf package and remove the hexagon grid without any bus stop which is indicated by NA value on the “BUS_STOP_N”. Next, I will calculate the total trips in a hexagonal grid using the group_by() from dplyr package.\n\n\nShow the code\ntotal_trips_per_grid_wdmp &lt;- st_join(honeycomb_grid_sf,total_trips_per_busstop_wdmp) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(BUS_STOP_N))%&gt;%\n  group_by(grid_id) %&gt;%\n  summarise(total_trips = sum(TRIPS))\n\n\n\n\n8.3 Replicating the Steps for Other Peak Hours\n\n8.3.1 Weekday Afternoon Peak\n\n\nShow the code\ntotal_trips_per_busstop_wdap &lt;- left_join(busstop3414, odbus_weekday_17_20, by = c(\"BUS_STOP_N\" = \"ORIGIN_PT_CODE\"))%&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(TRIPS))\n\ntotal_trips_per_grid_wdap &lt;- st_join(honeycomb_grid_sf,total_trips_per_busstop_wdap) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(BUS_STOP_N))%&gt;%\n  group_by(grid_id) %&gt;%\n  summarise(total_trips = sum(TRIPS))\n\n\n\n\n8.3.2 Weekends/Holiday Morning Peak\n\n\nShow the code\ntotal_trips_per_busstop_wemp &lt;- left_join(busstop3414, odbus_weekend_11_14, by = c(\"BUS_STOP_N\" = \"ORIGIN_PT_CODE\"))%&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(TRIPS))\n\ntotal_trips_per_grid_wemp &lt;- st_join(honeycomb_grid_sf,total_trips_per_busstop_wemp) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(BUS_STOP_N))%&gt;%\n  group_by(grid_id) %&gt;%\n  summarise(total_trips = sum(TRIPS))\n\n\n\n\n8.3.3 Weekends/Holiday Evening Peak\n\n\nShow the code\ntotal_trips_per_busstop_weep &lt;- left_join(busstop3414, odbus_weekend_16_19, by = c(\"BUS_STOP_N\" = \"ORIGIN_PT_CODE\"))%&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(TRIPS))\n\ntotal_trips_per_grid_weep &lt;- st_join(honeycomb_grid_sf,total_trips_per_busstop_weep) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(BUS_STOP_N))%&gt;%\n  group_by(grid_id) %&gt;%\n  summarise(total_trips = sum(TRIPS))"

    "text": "9 Geovisualisation and Analysis\nAfter the data preparation, I will first plot the distribution of passenger trips using ggplot() of tidyverse package. To consolidate these distributions into a single plot, it is necessary to introduce grouping variable to each dataframe. Within this unified plot, key summary statistics including Q1, median, Q3, and mean highligthed by a red circle will be presented. This approach aims to provide a comprehensive comparison of passenger trip characteristics across various peak hour groups.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Add a grouping variable to each dataframe\ntotal_trips_per_grid_wdmp$Peak_Hour_Group &lt;- \"wdmp\"\ntotal_trips_per_grid_wdap$Peak_Hour_Group &lt;- \"wdap\"\ntotal_trips_per_grid_wemp$Peak_Hour_Group &lt;- \"wemp\"\ntotal_trips_per_grid_weep$Peak_Hour_Group &lt;- \"weep\"\n\n# Combine dataframes into a single dataframe\ncombined_peak_hour &lt;- rbind(total_trips_per_grid_wdmp, total_trips_per_grid_wdap, total_trips_per_grid_wemp, total_trips_per_grid_weep) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(total_trips))\n\n# Create a box plot using ggplot\nggplot(combined_peak_hour, aes(x = Peak_Hour_Group, y = total_trips)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  stat_summary(fun = \"mean\", geom = \"point\", shape = 18, size = 3, color = \"red\")+\n  stat_boxplot(geom = 'errorbar', width = 0.5, color = 'blue', size = 1)+\n  stat_summary(\n    geom = 'text',\n    fun.min = function(x) quantile(x, 0.25),\n    fun = median,\n    fun.max = function(x) quantile(x, 0.75),\n    aes(label = sprintf(\"Q3: %.2f\\nMedian: %.2f\\nQ1: %.2f\", ..ymax.., ..y.., ..ymin..)),\n    vjust = -5,\n    hjust= -0.08,\n    position = position_dodge(width = 0.75),\n    size = 3\n  ) +\n  stat_summary(geom = 'text', fun = mean, aes(label = sprintf(\"Mean: %.2f\", ..y..)), vjust = -3, hjust=-0.08 ,  position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), color = 'red', size =3)+\n  \n  labs(title = \"Boxplot for Total Trips in each Peak Hour Group\", x=\"Peak Hour Group\",y = \"Passenger Trips\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe box plot analysis above reveal the patterns in Singapore’s bus passenger trips. Notably, the mean passenger trips during weekdays significantly surpass those on weekends and holidays, suggesting higher demand for bus services during typical workdays. This aligns with a common observation that commuting is more crowded on workdays, reflecting the daily hustle and bustle of the workforce.\nFurthermore, the observation that the mean of all peak hour groups exceeds their respective medians indicates a right-skewed distribution. This skewness implies that on average, there are more instances of relatively small number of passenger trips during peak hour with occasional instances of significantly higher demand. This distribution pattern underscores the challenges faced by commuters during peak hours, where a substantial portion of bus rides may experience higher congestion.\nSome hexagonal grid has a total of more than 400,000 passenger trips highlighting that specific areas with exceptionally high demand during the weekdays. These areas are likely represent key commuting regions with concentrated commercial and residential activities and are possibly areas that are not easily accessible by MRT. To gain clearer insights on the concentrations of high passenger trips I will leverage tmap package.\n\n9.1 Weekday Morning Peak\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\n\ntm_shape(total_trips_per_grid_wdmp) +\n  tm_fill(\n    col = \"total_trips\",\n    palette = c(\"#C5FFF8\", \"#FF4B91\"),\n    style = \"cont\",\n    title = \"Number of Trips\",\n    id = \"grid_id\",\n    showNA = FALSE,\n    alpha = 0.6,\n    popup.vars = c(\"grid_id\",\"total_trips\"),\n    popup.format = list(\n      grid_id = list(format = \"f\", digits = 0),\n      total_trips = list(format = \"f\", digits = 0))\n  ) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"grey40\", lwd = 0.7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\nIt has been observed that certain bus stops are located outside the boundaries of Singapore, particularly in Johor.The influx of weekday morning peak passenger trips from Johor are qhigh surpassing 100,000 for October 2023. This significant amount shows the cross border commuting activity between Johor and Singapore suggesting a preference among some individuals to reside in Johor may be due to cost consideration while working in Singapore.\nThe Central Business District (CBD) area displays a comparatively lower passenger trips generated by origin bus stop. This is attributed to the absence of major bus interchanges within the CBD, suggesting that commuters in this central business hub may rely on alternative modes of transportation, such as the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system. In addition, it is worth noting that lower passenger trips may also be influences by the fact that bus routes typically do not commence within CBD area, even though the bus routes pass through CBD.\nAreas that are exhibiting a high concentration during weekday morning peak are associated with prominent bus interchanges such as Woodlands and Boon Lay with more than 300,000 passenger trips within a single month on weekdays. Additionally, other bus interchanges including Bishan, Ang Mo Kio, Toa Payoh, Clementi, Punggol, Tampines, and Bedok also shows high passenger trips.\n\n\n9.2 Weekday Afternoon Peak\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\ntm_shape(total_trips_per_grid_wdap) +\n  tm_fill(\n    col = \"total_trips\",\n    palette = c(\"#C5FFF8\", \"#FF4B91\"),\n    style = \"cont\",\n    title = \"Number of Trips\",\n    id = \"grid_id\",\n    showNA = FALSE,\n    alpha = 0.6,\n    popup.vars = c(\"grid_id\",\"total_trips\"),\n    popup.format = list(\n      grid_id = list(format = \"f\", digits = 0),\n      total_trips = list(format = \"f\", digits = 0))\n  ) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"grey40\", lwd = 0.7)\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\nDuring the weekday afternoon peak, Woodlands and Boon Lay continue to exhibit an impressive volume of passenger trips exceeding 400,000 as compared to the patterns observed during morning peak. In addition, there are additional areas such as Ang Mo Kio, Tampines, and Bedok which emerge as significant contributors to the passenger trips during the later peak period.\nTypically the passengers volume during weekday afternoon are higher than weekday morning with Boon Lay with the highest contributor of more than 500,000 passenger trips. Boon Lay serves as a transportation hub for workers, residents and students from NTU. Moreover, the areas near Boon Lay are currently not accessible through MRT as the development of MRT is still in progress.\n\n\n9.3 Weekends/Holiday Morning Peak\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntm_shape(total_trips_per_grid_wemp) +\n  tm_fill(\n    col = \"total_trips\",\n    palette = c(\"#C5FFF8\", \"#FF4B91\"),\n    style = \"cont\",\n    title = \"Number of Trips\",\n    id = \"grid_id\",\n    showNA = FALSE,\n    alpha = 0.6,\n    popup.vars = c(\"grid_id\",\"total_trips\"),\n    popup.format = list(\n      grid_id = list(format = \"f\", digits = 0),\n      total_trips = list(format = \"f\", digits = 0))\n  ) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"grey40\", lwd = 0.7)\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\nGiven that weekends consist of only two days, the passenger trip numbers exhibit lower in total numbers but comparable to those recorded during five weekdays, following a similar pattern. Notably, major bus interchanges, such as Woodlands, Boon Lay, Bedok and Tampines continue to play a pivotal role contributing significantly to the overall passenger trips during both weekdays and weekends.\nDuring weekend and holidays, the morning peak hour (11am to 2pm) is later as compared to weekday morning (6 to 9am). This temporal shift can be attributed to social dynamic where individuals engaging in lunchtime activity with family and friends during weekends. This distinctive pattern underscores the influence of social interactions on commuter behaviors during non-working days.\n\n\n9.4 Weekends/Holiday Evening Peak\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntm_shape(total_trips_per_grid_weep) +\n  tm_fill(\n    col = \"total_trips\",\n    palette = c(\"#C5FFF8\", \"#FF4B91\"),\n    style = \"cont\",\n    title = \"Number of Trips\",\n    id = \"grid_id\",\n    showNA = FALSE,\n    alpha = 0.6,\n    popup.vars = c(\"grid_id\",\"total_trips\"),\n    popup.format = list(\n      grid_id = list(format = \"f\", digits = 0),\n      total_trips = list(format = \"f\", digits = 0))\n  ) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"grey40\", lwd = 0.7)\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\nSimilar with the other peak hours, the passenger trips are mostly contributed by major bus interchange as the origin.\nTypically , the afternoon/evening peak hours witnesses a higher volume of passenger trips both on weekdays and weekend as compared to morning peak hours. This preference may be due to individuals opting for MRT during hours as it provide punctual mode of transportation as compared to bus which might be affected by congestion and could potentially lead to delays in reaching to work/schools/leisure activities.\nDuring weekend and holidays, the evening peak hour (4 to 7pm) is slightly earlier as compared to weekday morning afternoon (5 to 8pm). This shift in timing could be attributed to the altered schedules and leisurely activities that individuals typically engage in during weekends and holidays. People might be more inclined to initiate their evening commutes earlier to accommodate social plans, family gatherings, or recreational activities that are common during non-working days."

    "text": "10 Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis\nExploratory Spatial Data Analysis or ESDA consists of descriptive techniques to discover spatial distribution of data and identify outliers. In this ESDA section, I will cover global spatial autocorrelation which focuses on overall trend and local spatial autocorrelation which focuses on hot and cold spots in the data.\n\n10.1 Global Spatial Autocorrelation\nIn this section, I will include the computation of global spatial autocorrelation statistics and spatial complete randomness test for global spatial autocorrelation. The goal here is to understand whether the passenger trips generated by origin are evenly distributed across Singapore.\n\n10.1.1 Spatial Weights Matrix\nBefore computing global spatial autocorrelation, we need to define spatial neighbourhood by using spatial weight. There are two common methods to compute spatial weight which are contiguity-based and distanced-based.\nIn contiguity-based method, neighbour share common boundary and there are 2 methods in defining the boundary, ROOK by common edge while QUEEN by common edge and vertices as shown below for square shape.\n\n\n\nHook Neighbors\n\n\n\n\n\nQueen Neighbors\n\n\nIn hexagonal grid, finding neighbours are straighforward. Both ROOK and QUEEN yield the same results as shown below.\n\n\n\nHexagon Neighbors\n\n\nIn distance-based method, there are 2 method fixed weighting where the grid are considered neighbours if they are within specified distance from one another and adaptive weighting where each grid has same specified number of neighbours.\nIf the hexagonal grid are isolated from each other, contiguity-based method may not be appropriate as it may yield many grids with no neighbours.\n\n\n10.1.2 Contiguity Weight Matrix (QUEEN)\nIn the code chunk below, I will use poly2nb() of spdep package to compute contiguity weight matrices for weekday morning peak hour. This function builds a list of neighbours based on grids with contiguous boundaries.

This function identifies neighbours of hexagonal grid centroid points by Euclidean distance with a lower and upper bounds distance controlled by the bounds argument or by Great Circle distance in kilometres if longlat argument is set to TRUE.\n\n10.1.5.1 Determine the cut-off distance\n\nReturn a matrix with the indices of points belonging to the set of the k nearest neighbours of each other by using knearneigh() of spdep.\nConvert the knn object returned by knearneigh() into a neighbours list of class nb with a list of integer vectors containing neighbour region number ids by using knn2nb().\nReturn the length of neighbour relationship edges by using nbdists() of spdep. The function returns in the units of the coordinates if the coordinates are projected, in km otherwise.\nRemove the list structure of the returned object by using unlist().\n\n\n\nShow the code\nk1 &lt;- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords))\nk1dists &lt;- unlist(nbdists(k1, coords, longlat = TRUE))\nsummary(k1dists)\n\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

However, we can still make some observations:\n\nThe above charts actually illustrates a characteristic of fixed distance weight matrix whereby the hexagonal grid of busttop origin in the centre of Singapore tend to have more neighbours and the edges of Singapore with lesser neighbours like Johor, Tanah Merah Coast.\nBased on the above charts, we can tell that the geographical areas of the regions in Singapore are highly connected by the bus.\n\n\n\n\n10.1.6 Adaptive Distance Weight Matrix\nTo overcome the issue of fixed distance weight matrix where there is uneven distribution of neighbours, we can use directly control the numbers of neighbours using k-nearest neighbours, as shown in the code chunk below.\nI will set k = 6 i.e., all hexagonal grids will have 6 neighbours for hexagonal grids.\n\n\nShow the code\nknn6 &lt;- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k=6))\nknn6\n\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 1492 \nNumber of nonzero links: 8952 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 0.4021448 \nAverage number of links: 6 \nNon-symmetric neighbours list\n\n\n\n\n10.1.7 Plotting distance based neighbours\n\n\nShow the code\npar(mfrow = c(1,2))\nplot(total_trips_per_grid_wdmp$area_honeycomb_grid, border = \"lightgrey\",main=\"6 nearest neighbours\" )\nplot(knn6, coords, add = TRUE, col = \"red\", length = 0.88, )\n\nplot(total_trips_per_grid_wdmp$area_honeycomb_grid, border = \"lightgrey\", main = \"Distance Link w KNN\")\nplot(knn6, coords, add = TRUE, pch = 19, cex = 0.6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.1.8 Determining Which Weights Matrix to Use\nSelecting a spatial weight matrix is use is dependent on the geographical area of interest and the focus of the study. Contiguity-based is preferred for hexagonal grid with uniform sizes because contiguity matrices are well-suited for regular grids where neighboring units share common boundaries. However, in my case, there are some hexagonal grid with no neighbour making contiguity-based not preferable. Therefore, I will use distance-based methods with adaptive distance spatial weight matrix because fixed distance has disadvantage where some regions only have 1 neighbour, while others may have 158 neighbours.\n\n\n10.1.9 Row-Standardised Weights Matrix\nAfter selecting the weight matrix to use, I will now assign weights to each neighboring polygon. Each neighboring polygon will be assigned equal weight (style=“W”) by assigning the fraction 1/(#of neighbors) to each neighbouring area. This is also known as a row-standardised matrix where each row in the matrix sums to 1.\n\n\nShow the code\nrswm_knn6 &lt;- nb2listw(knn6,\n                   style = \"W\",\n                   zero.policy = TRUE)\nrswm_knn6\n\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 1492 \nNumber of nonzero links: 8952 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 0.4021448 \nAverage number of links: 6 \nNon-symmetric neighbours list\n\nWeights style: W \nWeights constants summary:\n     n      nn   S0    S1       S2\nW 1492 2226064 1492 462.5 6048.333\n\n\nI will be using the row-standardised weight matrix for the next part of the analysis.\nNotes:\nThe input of nb2listw() must be an object of class nb. The syntax of the function has two major arguments, namely style and zero.poly.\n\nstyle can take values “W”, “B”, “C”, “U”, “minmax” and “S”. B is the basic binary coding, W is row standardised (sums over all links to n), C is globally standardised (sums over all links to n), U is equal to C divided by the number of neighbours (sums over all links to unity), while S is the variance-stabilizing coding scheme proposed by Tiefelsdorf et al. 1999, p. 167-168 (sums over all links to n).\nIf zero policy is set to TRUE, weights vectors of zero length are inserted for regions without neighbour in the neighbours list. These will in turn generate lag values of zero, equivalent to the sum of products of the zero row t(rep(0, length=length(neighbours))) %*% x, for arbitrary numerical vector x of length length(neighbours). The spatially lagged value of x for the zero-neighbour region will then be zero, which may (or may not) be a sensible choice.\n\nThe above processes are previously implemented on Weekday Morning Peak Hour. Next, I will implemented the same process as above for Weekday Afternoon Peak Hour, Weekends/Holiday Morning Peak Hour and Weekends/Holiday Evening Peak Hour\n\n\nShow the code\ntotal_trips_per_grid_wdap$area_honeycomb_grid &lt;- st_transform(total_trips_per_grid_wdap$area_honeycomb_grid, \"+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84\") \n\ncoords_wdap &lt;- st_coordinates(st_centroid(total_trips_per_grid_wdap$area_honeycomb_grid)) \nknn6_wdap &lt;- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords_wdap, k=6)) \nrswm_knn6_wdap &lt;- nb2listw(knn6_wdap,\n                   style = \"W\",\n                   zero.policy = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntotal_trips_per_grid_wdap$area_honeycomb_grid &lt;- st_transform(total_trips_per_grid_wdap$area_honeycomb_grid, \"+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84\")\ncoords_wdap &lt;- st_coordinates(st_centroid(total_trips_per_grid_wdap$area_honeycomb_grid)) \nknn6_wdap &lt;- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords_wdap, k=6)) \nrswm_knn6_wdap &lt;- nb2listw(knn6_wdap,\n                   style = \"W\",\n                   zero.policy = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntotal_trips_per_grid_wemp$area_honeycomb_grid &lt;- st_transform(total_trips_per_grid_wemp$area_honeycomb_grid, \"+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84\")\ncoords_wemp &lt;- st_coordinates(st_centroid(total_trips_per_grid_wemp$area_honeycomb_grid)) \nknn6_wemp &lt;- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords_wemp, k=6)) \nrswm_knn6_wemp &lt;- nb2listw(knn6_wemp,\n                   style = \"W\",\n                   zero.policy = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntotal_trips_per_grid_weep$area_honeycomb_grid &lt;- st_transform(total_trips_per_grid_weep$area_honeycomb_grid, \"+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84\") \ncoords_weep &lt;- st_coordinates(st_centroid(total_trips_per_grid_weep$area_honeycomb_grid)) \nknn6_weep &lt;- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords_weep, k=6)) \nrswm_knn6_weep &lt;- nb2listw(knn6_weep,\n                   style = \"W\",\n                   zero.policy = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n10.1.10 Computing Global Spatial Autocorrelation Statistics\nThis in sub-section, I will use two methods: Moran’s I and Geary’s C to test the hypothesis the following hypothesis:\n\nH0: Observed spatial patterns of values is equally likely as any other spatial pattern i.e. data is randomly disbursed, no spatial pattern\nH1: Data is more spatially clustered than expected by chance alone.\n\nMoran’s I\nI will perform Moran’s I statistical testing by using moran.test() of spdep pacakage.

This means that data is more spatially clustered than expected by chance alone. Since Moran I statistics are larger than 0, the observation are clustered, observations tend to be similar.\nComputing Monte Carlo Moran’s I\nIf there are doubts that the assumptions of Moran’s I are true (normality and randomisation), a Monte Carlo simulation is used to perform a permutation test for Moran’s I.\nThe permutation tests consists of randomly reassigning the attribute values to a cell under the assumption of no spatial pattern. This random assignment is conducted n times. Each time, I will compute the Moran’s I to crerate an empirical distribution of Moran’s I under H0.\nThe code chunk below performs permutation test for Moran’s I statistic by using moran.mc() of spdep package with a total of 1000 simulation.\n\n\nShow the code\nset.seed(1234)\nbperm= moran.mc(total_trips_per_grid_wdmp$total_trips, \n                listw=rswm_knn6, \n                nsim=999, \n                zero.policy = TRUE, \n                na.action=na.omit)\nbperm\n\n\n\n    Monte-Carlo simulation of Moran I\n\ndata:  total_trips_per_grid_wdmp$total_trips \nweights: rswm_knn6  \nnumber of simulations + 1: 1000 \n\nstatistic = 0.20667, observed rank = 1000, p-value = 0.001\nalternative hypothesis: greater\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nset.seed(1234)\nbperm_wdap= moran.mc(total_trips_per_grid_wdap$total_trips, \n                listw=rswm_knn6_wdap, \n                nsim=999, \n                zero.policy = TRUE, \n                na.action=na.omit)\nbperm_wdap\n\n\n\n    Monte-Carlo simulation of Moran I\n\ndata:  total_trips_per_grid_wdap$total_trips \nweights: rswm_knn6_wdap  \nnumber of simulations + 1: 1000 \n\nstatistic = 0.062498, observed rank = 1000, p-value = 0.001\nalternative hypothesis: greater\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nset.seed(1234)\nbperm_wemp= moran.mc(total_trips_per_grid_wemp$total_trips, \n                listw=rswm_knn6_wemp, \n                nsim=999, \n                zero.policy = TRUE, \n                na.action=na.omit)\nbperm_wemp\n\n\n\n    Monte-Carlo simulation of Moran I\n\ndata:  total_trips_per_grid_wemp$total_trips \nweights: rswm_knn6_wemp  \nnumber of simulations + 1: 1000 \n\nstatistic = 0.15686, observed rank = 1000, p-value = 0.001\nalternative hypothesis: greater\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nset.seed(1234)\nbperm_weep= moran.mc(total_trips_per_grid_weep$total_trips, \n                listw=rswm_knn6_weep, \n                nsim=999, \n                zero.policy = TRUE, \n                na.action=na.omit)\nbperm_weep\n\n\n\n    Monte-Carlo simulation of Moran I\n\ndata:  total_trips_per_grid_weep$total_trips \nweights: rswm_knn6_weep  \nnumber of simulations + 1: 1000 \n\nstatistic = 0.10595, observed rank = 1000, p-value = 0.001\nalternative hypothesis: greater\n\n\nSince the p-value is &lt; 0.05, we have sufficient statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the 95% level of confidence.

Geary’s C range from -1 to an undefined number above 1.

While for weekends/holiday, there are more yellow referring to outliers except for the south part of Singapore, there is a noticeable cluster with green shade.\n\n\n11.2 Plotting LISA Cluster Map\nThe local Moran’s I value alone is not enough to show spatial clustering because it does not tell us whether the value of the variable being tested is high or low and whether the test result was significant. Therefore, I will assign each observation to a quadrant depending on the value of the variable on the y-axis (centred around the mean) and Moran’s I on the x-axis. Quadrant 1 contains coldspots and quadrant contains hotspot as follows:\n\n\n\nLISA_Quadrant\n\n\nLISA Cluster Maps also categorises each region into one of five groups: (1) High-High, (2) High-Low, (3) Low-High, (4) Low-Low and (5) Insignificant.\nThe following steps are conducted to prepare for LISA cluster map:\n\nCreate a vector of the same length as the number of hexagonal grid in each peak hour datasets.\nDerive a variable, DV by using a by using the spatially lagged version of total_trips and center it around its means.

Overall, Local Moran’s have revealed significant spatial cluster and outliers.\nFrom the results above, it is noticed that there are only 3 type of quadrants which are insignificant, low-high and high-high. For ease of interpreting the result, below are the maps of Singapore regions.\n\n\n\nSingapore Regions\n\n\nWeekday Morning Peak Hour:\nFrom the Local Moran’s I map, there are some hexagonal grids with positive Local Moran’s I values and they have neigbours with another high or low passenger trip grids. This consistent with the LISA maps. The high-high clusters spread across Singapore while the low-high outliers are typically near the high-high clusters. The hexagonal grid near the Singapore Malaysia border (Johor and edges near the border) are high-high cluster indicating a high level of cross country activities during the weekday morning.\nWeekday Afternoon Peak Hour:\nThe cluster with high-high characteristics are distributed throughout Singapore with exception of West Singapore where only low-high outliers are apparent. This is attributed to the presence of Boon Lay Bus Interchange as the sole busy interchange in the western region, leading to comparatively lower passenger trips in the other parts of West Singapore.\nWeekends/Holiday Morning Peak Hour:\nThe cluster with high-high characteristics are distributed throughout Singapore especially in the CBD/Central area where a significant concentration of passenger trips are observed during these times. This elevated activities may be influenced by various factors such as recreational activities, family/friend gathering, etc., contributing to the high level of engagement and movement in the CBD area.\nWeekends/Holiday Evening Peak Hour:\nThe distribution of high-high cluster and low-high outliers are quite similar with Weekends/Holiday Morning Peak Hour except that the high-high cluster are wider around the CBD area during evening and there is no high-high cluster around the Yishun area as compared to weekends/holiday morning peak hour."

    "text": "12 Conclusion\nIn this take-home exercise, ESDA was used to generate insights about the distribution of passenger trips in Singapore. Using the Global Spatial Autocorrelation Statistics, it is noted that there is existence of spatial autocorrelation for all peak hour groups as whole analysis using Moran’s I statistical test. However, when employing Geary’s C, which accounts for differences with immediate neighbors, the data on weekday afternoon peak hour passenger trips is determined to be randomly dispersed, showing no discernible spatial pattern.\nThe existence of spatial autocorrelation led me to use local spatial autocorrelation statistics like LISA cluster maps to identify areas of clusters and outliers. Understanding the uneven distribution of passenger trips for different peak hours will be crucial for optimizing public transportation infrastrcuture, managing congestion and enhancing overall urban mobility.\nIn conclusion, the insights gained from both global and local spatial autocorrelation analyses contribute to a comprehensive understanding of passenger trip patterns for targeted interventions and strategic planning which in turn help to improve the efficiency and sustainability of transportation systems in Singapore. To enhance the depth of transportation dynamics analysis, future work could explore destination-specific or individual bus route considerations."
